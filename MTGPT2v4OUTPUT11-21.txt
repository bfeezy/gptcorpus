WOODSON, N.J., July 06, 2015 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- U.S. Naval Tanker Newports, with a first class fleet of 147 boats, is embarking on its 77th year of operations this month and will mark the 70th Anniversary of the U.S. Navy with all 229 vessels achieving a Blue from Caution this year<|endoftext|>Sydney City Council approved a package of policies Thursday banning workplace discrimination and calling for transparency in the city's corporate compliance.

The measures, adopted unanimously at City Hall, will promote a culture in which companies feel "alienated" amid antagonism between employees and their owners. The measures also include expanded workplace responsibility, transparency, enforcing reasonable hours of work, hiring diversity and increasing equity within the city.

Fairchild Wipeout and Safe Handles of Australia Incorporated received permits to reopen at Cherry Road and Elizabeth Street in 2014 and 2015 after the owners, who own the building, canceled a license renewal. They are now the only commercial business within two blocks of Sidewalk Fifth.
Following Thursday's final vote, a short-windowed message from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull painted a picture of concern.
"I hope these measures also represent an opportunity to embrace the diversity and diversity of talents that permeate our city. … if there remains consensus to create new policy measures that serve both the public and those with distinctly different views, then the interests of every single residential or business in Sydney will prosper."

City staff reported during day one of 2017 many unhappy customers and residents as they responded to the Municipal Budweiser store being pulled off the street during the Super Bowl festivities in 2017.

I really like Lost Souls. It is perfect for the funeral rite guide looking to warm up before piling into the cold.
And the same way, it is perfect for advanced players of Magic: the Gathering who want to wage an intelligent game of Many In One with nobody so much as floating a finger.

First off, there's the fact that I bought this set in ten packs. It sells for ten dollars. Stawhawk did too. The phrases "you can buy ten sets" or "you can't" should be in the rules. Anyone in the era of hypercomics can remember a time when tiny white coins worth five cents were aspirational commonplace possessions. Modern cards often sell for $1 apiece.
Not too shabby for a set that deals with the plague just three years after the scourge became manifest. Not too shabby for a set that deals with the plague just three years after the scourge became manifest.

======================================== SAMPLE 21 ========================================
Season 11 has started and I've already met with the best potential seasons 2015 and 2016 by far so far!
The Vojov crew completely changed up the way I approached my league in this season.  During mid season I was doing everything with Blindmakes.  I mean worship pushing defenders.  I still tried to draft a disciplined, defensive minded deck, but without the laser sharpness.  BUT, I doubled down on blindmakes.  The way it was if I woke up every morning I'd be firing the crew at everyone.  That way there was no need to pick every time you woke up because you knew I was out of the line of fire.
Now, I'm not excited by any of the cool plans that were floated to bring in mechanics like Land Tax on Day One.  For one thing, we don't really know what Land Tax does, nor do we even know how much you'll pay based on what cards you own, making them barely relevant.  Secondly, they're coming straight off of Eye of Katarinti.  This could be crucial.  Lag gobo/aertoids already exist and I doubt Katarinti is going to switch over to frostbitten mice anytime soon.  Why would she abate her snow dryer and leave right off the bat one of Katarinti's hottest mechanics in play because it turns out she isn't thirsty for snow dryer his Majesty merits?  Meaning we'll start off looking through my board in vain, skipping Pokemons for more buys.
The chances of what I've been saying in my present state of awkwardly ironic indignation superceding it already being insanely terrible are vanishingly small.  Melaleuca sent some lucky Klick notice down there to her eternal thanks.

THE SEVEN THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE DYAMITE DRAGONS
OF TARIIBANK
By KIM RYAN
Oregon State University Press


We're sitting at the demo stand of a sleek old private jet, restricted entry only to children, in a giant Memorial Stadium concrete bowl surrounded by ruggedly situated factory paths. Rich Rogers and I have barely spoken while getting caught up in conversations about underwear-stall cursors and dotage-spell detection synergy. We're feeling good about ourselves, though. Though it's obviously been twelve years since I last rode out a drag strip on Kazakhstan's own homegrown runway.
Oursterium, as the geography girls first called it, is neither half-funded nor transforming tired narrow volt Tremorics. Its most coordinated observers describe it as", but we all have ideas." Kin-Taeon's ideas are a collection of smaller, slightly opposed devices. These are carving tools. They are inches from me!"
Rocket-Citząk, what are make adjustments like?" Kin-Taeon welcomes Kin-Sarā'wā.
BOOM!
BOOM! The sound becomes relieved exasperation. It's sardonic, but to the punters it's the right loud gas.
I break eye contact with the bird. The bird don't look at me. Right. It's called Búbún the Ancestorself about as often as its crest resembles the face of Satan.
"Welcome to Kin-Taeon Estate," says Tsevyyborn, and he's in full title — king of Kin-Taeon, Freyalise of Bruges, baroness of the Gifts of Worlds Elfs Laureate.
He radiates an aura of authority, even though his task here is to bring socat once more to its rightful owners by allowing them to get their pets. The watching nobles, who only blink upon seeing the drawn satyrs in their fixtures, don't even offer principal ceremony except to make sure Vardenfell is well accessible.
He's also watching me. See, customer service is his strength. He hardly lets the botanists or makers of emetic munificences do anything but fuddle him and feet him. He likes to get them all excited about something stupid for months down the road.
BOOM!
He crashes on the mat leg where I'm just warming up.
"Watch your virulence!"
He kneels and presses his face against my arm.
"I think I might have a solution."
We fight.
BOOM!

======================================== SAMPLE 28 ========================================
ACHAROA, Calif. - A severely impaired Downsia police officer who received an honorable discharge for his faith do for Maine, B.C., has told a federal appeals court he will not step down as a Maine police officer after the outcome of a lawsuit is appealed.

The two cities both voted in March to recall the officer whose passions drew him to brush fire filled protectorate John Theodore "Meehan" Goldsborough's bark during an altercation involving 574 persons in an Algoma restaurant parking lot on October 27-28, 2012.
The officer subsequently walked away frozen in mid-sentence, crashing another police vehicle, injuring several in the process and suffering several broken ribs before slipping into a coma as he lay dying in the hospital bed.
The riots that ensued could well have ended differently had Butch Pownall stayed behind.
The legal action began in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Maine, where Goldsborough launched his appeal Tuesday.
The municipal court judge overseeing his appeal called Goldsborough's decision to step down a grave mistake without apology or justification, because it excluded his fellow officers and the public from the public issues at hand during that volatile time.
"It was an incompetent and dangerous mistake," said judge Douglas McGuire.
Attorney Jeff Siegel said the analogy is telling because Pownall was wearing his way out.
"Everyone should take the lead on issues equally, not try to play the role of judge and jury while at the same time fueling the fights. Of course, an officer will get injured or killed at some point, but they shouldn't be recognized for that moment."
Siegel countered that officers who do not follow their own religion's code of conduct often wind up with fatal accidents or, as Pownall's case suggests, provides evidence to show an inner inner conflict.
"Kingsbury dominates all other students, including other officers. That sort of thing distorts our perceptions, promotes the unhealthy thinking that like you get your rocks from the ground and you know you don't get to chew them, that your actions matter more than thought and action and good judgment."
Outcome read 'Wicked chief'
McGuire retained its 'Wicked' designation.
HIGHVIEW NEW ALBBANY — No disrespect to the local paper's writing, but it seems the ABS wasn't happy with Kansas City's decision to land dirt aeroplane vendor Learjet 19 from Houston and move it to Broadview, Kan.
Leary born, raised, lived in Kansas City, and over the years was passed around by bureaucrats from KCATA to mauveade proposals galore — even from the new vehicles' possessor.

MIDDLE EAST CITY — Fifteen years removed from Hurricane Katrina, five-year-old Capri-first-hour survivor Pascale Davis is fighting the drain.
Davis, whose name means "friends, mother," patiently paces every step of Garden Avenue in a teal special-edition Farmhouse 1500, affixed with her sister's name embroidered on its side.
A tall man in a recreation tank top laughs with delight as no one waves, enjoys the moment and is rewarded by a gust of his breath. One minute he's heard a skirmish outside his front door, the next raucously singing on the Hip Town Lawn.
Davis, wantonly knocked out, charged off her wheelchair with pride and rejoined her family atop the veranda in Garden Oaks Estates.
BATON ROUGE — Many observers dismissed the facts of the trial of the town's police chief Oliver Jean-Pierre as a cynical smirk. But the jury's verdict — that Jean-Pierre conspired with the high school football team, and a town administrator, in promoting that opinion — not only creates an emphasis on a cynicism that is more human than military, but among me.
BATON ROUGE — Bernard O'Halofic was sitting casually on the rowan box Friday at King's Rest neighborhood bar when he stepped outside and made a bold statement that gathered immediate applause from those about to be in court: He said wrong.

In an email to NBA details, the five-year-old, now-defunct Sodexo Pizza explained on Jan. 16, 1997, the hotel was set to honour a 15-year-old who had recently taken her over the Passing Wall for one month, so they were too wet to remember her name.
Goeff, they perceive, was normally myselfuly ill to even see her.
Nonetheless, their Newark grad had thousands of Sarah Kardash picket posters and shirts on their walls, and deserves tonight's Kneebone Keeper tattoo of "YOUNGSTOWN."
I was down the hall when it came in, and I was surprised to discover, like so many things going on at Golden Gopher Stadium, nothing of significance — like, say, smell detectoret disconnection Switchputer VReteritis — would have happened.
Goeff wasn't even supposed to have been flogged.
Seriously?<|endoftext|>I just put the MacBook air i5 in as my primary laptop, and I think it has pretty strong performance for a budget thing.First of all, the SSD is bad for something like that. I've got two macbook Air for details, each was bought different hardware.The first macbook ead worn it for about 5 years, after a sip of macdaddy (I think) and then I tear it open and looked at it for about 5nights.It doesn't just suck, as it was only semi-inhabitable for that time after floppy generation, so I couldn't really complain.I've seen multiple other Afterburner changes, but I'm fairly sure they aren't related to proper sanctification when partitioning.I think replacing the cooling fan on top would be a better idea. It's far superior to relegation on the old ones at full throttle. Mort linked things with a 3UR TPM for speed/readability; I believe the ASRock controller bad with the pad dying after judicious rotation/recovery. I also am very angry at the foreign metal plate to cover the cable between the SSD and the motherboard. Because the metal plates are so useless, I have to use hardwood bushes to hook the cable on the side structure for proper shielding.The ead shouldn't be pulled when doing tech work, otherwise the near instant cool difference will give the machine away.That's enough for now.<|endoftext|>Maggie Lawson strongly defended her fake "superman" costume to BBC Radio 2's Today programme this afternoon, saying that it was "as genuine as possible".

On the broadcast, the presenter quizzed Ms Lawson about whether she believed the twin-tongued graduate sported the costume as a prank, saying: "Did you say no to Peter Finch in That Was 1985?"

Ms Lawson, 68, bluntly replied "No, not really" when the leader of the opposition George Galloway asked her to be more specific about how her surpluses from donating money to charity went in it.
Praising Geoff Mulligan for making the comment about her donation to the Doctors' Stock, the former shadow international development secretary replied: "We made a statement on that in Parliament last year, you know ? We thought it was read."
One Times journalist tweeted: "Keith Vaz apologised. But look at how MG acted!"
Hedge fund manager Mr Galloway got the jokes across to the crowd of 19,000, who cheered when she said she had a 6ft height recognition identity card.
Katie Hopkins, standing close behind, says:"I'd never heard of Maggie Lawson so let's just say this is serious business."
Ms Lawson admitted that some people might get annoyed with her for looking like "a celebrity with a catch".
She said she had bought the costume for her undergraduate an-rex Englandist, as a child she was enchanted to wear one at Oxford.
Ms Lawson said she hated being envy-plagued about half-naked images everywhere - so did Mr Galloway - but she does not want to reveal what she wears to Thursday's post-election Q&A.

======================================== SAMPLE 37 ========================================
STUDY DESIGN:

To date, tetraethyleneglycol (TEGG) has only been tested in humans in inhalation and body absorption studies. Further, toxicity studies in rats and mice have been unsuccessful because TEGG oxidizes to form polyproteridine (PPRO). To test the ability of noninsoluble TEGG metabolites to simultaneously oxidize metabolically to PPRO, two 3-(4,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl-tetraethylhydrazines (TEGTIM:DPO) were isolated. Rats were trained to inhale the 3-(4,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl-TEGTIM:DPO metabolites and quantify PPRO. Nitric oxide at the proximal vapor membrane was measured during inhalation and urine pore breathing. Male Wistar-R rats (6 months old) received 500 mg/kg/day, i.p. supplementation for eight weeks. Arsenic, indole, madder peppercorn, myrcene,/POO-POPO-APOY-FLOR, and CPTP did not produce significant PPRO formation after exposure to the TEGTIM TEGTIM:DPO metabolites for 12 h. Enzymatic LD additional metabolites were produced in urine without losing their PPRO form. The PPRO metabolites seemed unchanged in the urine of TEGTIM:DPO-fed rats run-fore. Because this dose of TEGTIM:DPO metabolites constitutes metabolically equivalent PPRO, parenteral administration of the TEGTIM dose required effective bronchodilation mechanism to 10% by ventilation to reach lung isozymes.
TEGTIM:DPO-fed rats were challenged with a human carotid artery occlusion, i.p. for 30 min, and examined skin suture repositioning and retention to give a limited sampling of tissue biopsies for autologous (gi)von Eidenhoven Connective Tissue Analysis (TEA) as primary outcome. High resolution KEGG-quality TEGGwas assayed by a microtextomagnetodontometer. Single and multiple immunofluorescent RT-PCRs were performed with different combinations of TEGGbiofilm elution materials placed on 25 mm anneal. Complete RT-PCR results were best representative of study group 6 as defined in limit sequence analysis template 47 (WDC, Reston, VA, USA), Pearson's test20 or standard deviation analysis analyzer (GAX, Landsberg, Gottingen, Germany).
CONCLUSION:
TEGG is small, nonenzymatic pore-forming molecule that activates endothelial pathways that oxidize in great earnest to PPRO when exposed to short-term oxygen concentration effects. First, adequate pore formation in conditions around large omissions permits a more robust fractionation effect to eliminate undesirably inhibited enzymes which appear to be preferentially hyperproliferative in high concentrations of O 2 .

Glad, divine Companions! Perhaps no clash upon which overbearing imaginations strike bloodier chords may be but worthy of the ritual .

"When we heard that she had been attacked, we talked to each other and decided to make sure no other hikers were getting hurt," Captain Giordano said.
Gio assessed the situation on Thursday.
"Thinking the sirens were going to be blowing for the rest of the night, I opened my site closer on the trail," he said. "When I got down there actually saw once again every scuff and scratch the path had suffered from storms."
Threat to hikers' safety
Gio heaped praise on her approach.
"She showed that she's willing to show concern and protection to others," he said.
The two planned to hang out.
However, seconds after he reached his house, the woman wearing the hat and her 14-year-old grandson got suspicious.
"She turned around, walked up to them, pointed to my wife's head and then the entire group looked at me in disbelief," Gio said. "I told them I was the responsible party in his presence and they got out of there."
Gio didn't expect to experience similar hostility.
"There were a lot of hikers in there, but they didn't have to worry about me," he said. "I took their calls and they listened."
He says people also walk all the way up to the base of the Wi Field on their bikes. He called Seattle Police to confirm.
"Worried about what's going to happen outside? What's going to happen down here on the trail? We're going to restore the Wi Field!" he said.
Gio finished his coffee and packed up his backpack.
"I've been walking the Firewalker trail for a long time. Usually it feels much more secure."
THREAT FROM FRIENDS
The Internet is buzzing with speculation following the attack.
Some say the victim might be a friend of a cheating accomplice. Plan reposted domestic violence model; that only happened because a friend jumped her to create action.
It all adds to the creepy vibe of Biklig. Enthusiasts say the victims were just picky followers. Sorority sisters who got into a sports fight bc they were stood up in front of lightning speed ultimately couldn't catch a rival.
"When wristbands showed up, we thought they were ID badges," said Mark Woodhead, who sold his business Peace of Mind comforts to Seattle's hand-written fiberglass shop That Guy, but his clientele started to grow after he packaged Rickshaw City's "Reach" T-shirts, lettered with its logo.
What's written on the wristbands isn't written correctly.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Abdulrahim al-Adiesin, father of Houthi leader Abd-Rabbu Mansour's deputy, died in a crash aged 64, his family said on Sunday.

Abdulrahim al-Adiesin (R), father of Houthi leader Abd-Rabbu Mansour's deputy, attends the 96th event of the Joint Resistance & Unity Rally held at Riyadh National University, the Houthis' official venue, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, August 24, 2016. REUTERS/Riyadh Governorate
In the annual rally held for their supporters in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's second-richest prince, the Houthis announced their resignations late on Sunday and Hussein al-Adiesin told crowd of more than 2,000 that he intended to run Hassan's contenders in elections in 2018.

Al-Adiesin's election strategy lauded by the rally's organisers concerned whether tribesmen would vote to include the new overlord at local elections.
Mohamed Adeeb, 79, is seen during an interview in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, March 25, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer
Hussein Adeeb, 83, said voters wearing headbands signed "Mohamed" were asked to cast their ballots for the 57-year-old former deputy to replace Hussein who is in the last years of a two-year term and heading toward 100-year rule.
Adjeebsin said on Twitter that he had asked the crowd to join the queue for the coronation of Hassan.

Crowds with portraits of Hassan craned necks to watch the results.

A Reuters witness saw him walking out in grandfather, brother who was riding him, and took his seat as an assistant.
The Houthis have ramped up their campaign in Yemen, seizing Sanaa, Marib province and the capital Sanaa for nine months; they are also conducting air strikes near Sanaa's airport.
Hussein Abu-Adeeb, 52, said he had voted for Hassan, 66, on Sunday but he did so reluctantly since he did not know who his brother was.
"Hussain has committed more than anyone else to Yemen's future, he has remained with us through mire (tunnels in the capital) and coral and today he has stepped down," Adeeb said.
Casting a wide net, the Houthis had grasped the historic chance to shape Yemen's alliance with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.
Their recent victories under Al-Hussein seem to be political victories as well.
Hussein was questioned about his claims that victory masked Sunni-Shiite military fractions, but the former Yemen minister said: "We are big supporters of downplayed evils..."
TROUBLE IN AL-HAWTHEDI
The Houthis claimed they had crossed an air islet into the Gulf of Aden and took control of the main port, Aden.
Lahab Aljabaeesh, a lawyer advising both sides of the conflict, said there was little doubt its power extended from the coast to Al-Shaida Channel which connects to the Red Sea.
"The rebels control only al-Wefaa but they have a number of minor seaside or coral ports which does not show up on the map," al-Jabaeesh told Reuters.
The Islamist rebels control Aden's Rada Beach and on Tuesday will invade the southern suburbs of Aden, trapping the Pitebs and preventing the dispersal of the army.
The Houthis have captured Bajazet town and junction with Parwan in Yemen's south and Parwan, Al-Bayda, Sanaa.
HUNGARY DISAPPEARS MOVEMENT
Sweden's Örebro Defence told Reuters there was no sign of the UK or USA sending special equipment or armaments in response to the Houthis.
Milind Lourensutpader told Reuters ministers did not seem prepared to send anyone to the African Union peacekeeping headquarters in Addis Ababa.
"The prime minister said last week that his government was sending possible peacekeeping forces but expressed reluctance to send anybody to the peacekeeping building over this situation."

MINNEAPOLIS --- The Vikings are 5-0 since Christmas night and want to send two Ann Bills taking a bus up to town to taste ways to improve the team.
Vikings coach Mike Zimmer hugged his receiver Stefan Raczk Draitenschlager after kicking a 38-yard field goal during practice Sunday. He then turned to his teammates and posed for a group photo.
"We're going to get to Buffalo, we're going to get to New Orleans, and eventually the Vikings are going to get to 4-kills," said Draitenschlager, 9.
Raczk says, "Coach, guys, come here."
Raczk grabs a Voltage skiing stick at MN Fans Nest Stadium. The Walum Hills in freefall. He won't go down without getting a ski bump.

THEY SAID IT: "I don't know about that."
THE STATISTICS: Doyle becomes just the fourth player in program history to score in 60 consecutive games during the regular season. He also becomes just the third player in program history to score at least three goals in every game during a stretch in which he was considered the real alternative to team captain Steve Yzerman, who suffered a season-ending broken nose in a loss to Georgetown on Nov. 30.
POLL IMPLICATIONS: Doyle scored in a way he knows well. During the past several games, he has employed an aggressive, go-to pivot. The change of pace — meaning no running or passing of any kind — followed the Cavaliers' early momentum.
What TO WATCH FOR: What Doyle usually does is just pick his spots and upstage teammates. But he chafes against a league that occasionally pushes complacent defenses to the limit, perpetually feasting on any unopened market.
THE STATISTICS: Doyle gets next to nothing to eat during the playoffs. But he tried to say that to this reporter as he tossed a Kris Draper dinner tackful of horseshoe crab. — Andrew (Buyer Beware)

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- Hill won 11 straight games to become Virginia's all-time leader in career wins and the oldest coach to hold that distinction.

Hill's vineyard defends-champion dominance now hangs above 19,457 as he pursues another double-digit acquisition this spring -- Justin Long.
STORY: Successful free agent to leave: Teachings from Billick
Frank Beamer, the legendary coach whose overall record stands at 44-50-9, lives on in history.
Beamer's Norfolk Admirals made history in 2013 by coping with Long's send-up escape at Nationals, but the 60-year-old Hall of Famer will forever be known by Virginia's win record.
Beamer hired Long, 27, after establishing the Crimson Tide's dominant tradition in 1988 and '91. He picked him 22nd in 2010 but tacked on 3½ years after he was hired at Virginia.
Beamer's top sigh:  declined fans' phone calls because nobody would answer them.
High school coach: Owns school record of 28 losses.
Best hiring assistant: 4.
Lowest appointment:  None.

Which tool should I use?
As far as I'm aware, the consensus is that it really depends on the situation you're trying to solve and the circumstances you're in. The only basic rule is that you must be not in a room with a stupid skilled obsidian-clad weapon system ready to use it.
Let me give you an example of a modern scenario. Imagine you have a party of 3-10 characters in a session of D&D and someone falls down a well, smashes it, not realizing that's where you are going with it, leaving you completely naked and unhorned. Do you have any options?
Bear in mind that my choices are automatic and a fraction of the time is up to you. Any suggestions?
Quote All you get are consequences
Notable consequences: To the Employed Lord (as for the second target triggered signature), Altho you have two targets at your theater, do 14+ strength points in plating, kill all three, flashback me.  Or... you could take 17+ you to the Guildpact, as you get 2 options.  You could take my tools but immediately shut your door.  Or kill everyone on sight.  If you have a choice, do the first three two at least a dozen times, up to two hundred times, and then inevitably disappear.
At the end of your journal, are you satisfied or are you a bit sick?  This power, powerful as it is, did reduce my anonymity to multiple reasonable identities.  No money, no life—survival.
Is if a finite resource?  Definitely, so even if less resource is given to you than in the other stories—and that and injuries—you can light yourself on fire and make yourself accessible.

LAWRENCE, Kan. (CN) – A microwave oven manufacturer says requiring passwords on every oven that triggers an alarm requires giving the public no security.

In a lawsuit filed today in Kansas City, Mo., Denver-based Lumen Weddle accuses the Consumer Product Safety Commission of failing to pass along the passwords.

The complaint claims the CPSC failed to inform consumers of the rules about emergency "grab-bag watches" on September 28, 2014, after reports of a knife-cap version of the safe. Eight seconds later, sales of these single-use, blanked, reusable, fingerless devices began to pop up.
– Advertisement –
That's the violation in Minneapolis.
The breach occurred on September 28, 2014, when the kitchen-sink Mercury simulating oven pulled its initial trigger triggering a pop by the handle. The release of co-founder Dave Kelley worries children may have slipped into the faintly disorienting safeguards for entrée.
The meant to be decorative device became the problem.

January and March, 2014, the complaint argues, have seen the rise in numbers of locked sharp prongs. Locks are no longer held by the manufacturer's housewives. The filing requests discovery on the Maryland city's breach strategy.

The Sunlight Foundation notes there has been no additional update saying the thumb-slick pores are sealed.
The fourth group that came into renters' possession said goof-ups harnessed the architect's epitaph more than it would have favored.
In March 2015, tech writer Plaid Packets broke the news that an official giveaway giveaway window — gift every single design on Twitter — was closing, cherished for misunderstood consumer satisfactions suited into ties anding outs. Included below are photos of the perfectly-sealed gift packages and an encouraging note to put them away:

The people of Zobirussia correctly arrived at the conclusion that to become independent, the Weimar Republic had to be deserted.

In 2012, Los Angeles stopped calling itself Los Angeles, attempted to capitalize on the Homie Theory—a tight "us"—by rebranding itself as "CL." There was, after all, plenty of money to be made in blowing things up.

It was too late.

======================================== SAMPLE 66 ========================================
FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- If Eli Manning can't live up to expectations, Mike Glennon would do far better as the team's backup.

That's why when quarterback Peyton Manning sat out practice Friday due to a possible concussion he offered a similar perspective to his co-captain.
Brooklyn Decker, making just his second start, asked about his quarterback teammates and read aloud a message from South Jersey's team:
"Broncos around here aren't (about). . . When we win, nothing's wrong with me."
Brandi Tomac treated it as a punchline.
Eli jammed his fingers into his handbag before shooting his jersey.
"If I'm going to get caught, I'm going to get caught early,'' he said after the first full practice of the season.
The Flyers including Peyton Newton and starting quarterback Nick Foles have won two bench passes by asking about the rest of the Giants. Goalie Scott O'Neill briefly dismissed that possibility when calling Brandon Belt a bum when Carmel Boone dropped him a quick correction:
"Is that Brandon?" Mike Robson asked.
"No, that's not Brandon, that's Len,'' Lowry replied. "That's Marcus. Tonight do the show.''
None of it surprised Manning, who knew his team was still deep after 28-16 beating, and a big win this coming Tuesday in Chicago -- and all of a sudden he's at a disadvantage because the Giants can't touch him.
"I think we're in a better spot right now than we were at halftime,'' Manning said. "Just when you're battling to knock off a team like that overnight, you usually lose. But we're in it."
John Mozeliak might be among the Giants, if not the only one, to dominate both conversation and news media over the past three days about whether Eli Manning is healthy enough to even make a crack at fusing with his dad at this early stage. Mozeliak didn't offer any reasons for why this might be, but there were plenty in the Ponce ecosystem that supported the notion, fans and media alike.
John Paczkowski encountered a topic worth dissecting on Tuesday: the Giants' offensive line, which has to play at Brandywine Woods earlier than usual to improve next season. Consequently, pistol for mountain George Loyer seemed like a reasonable agent of positive change. Unfortunately, Loyer didn't clear the mailbox, nor was a noble change penalty suggested for Loyer's shootoff with catcher Adrian Baker.
Justin Tuck hopes that the Giants win a backup position and keep him in place patiently as rookie centerfielder Jordan Zimmermann weeds out the 2017 season.
On this 31-man roster: 2B Dan Haren, OF Randall Delgado, C Jedd Gyorko, RHP Laurent Robinson, LHP Jake Honeycutt, RP Placido Polanco, RP Carl Pavano, RP Pietro Arroyo, RP Sam Bruce.
Here's how Slanted View put the elephant in the room.

MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — Fulton County police are investigating after a toddler died in a snowball fight.
Astrid Guasti, 15, died Thursday during the kids pool drinking ritual she had been practicing.
The incident happened near Ritchie Beachwell on the Gazebo right back in the summer of 2014.
The apparent dry run was going on as far back as August of 2011. Both were dressed in their best Christmas outfits and all people here on Ritchie Beachwise knew who got to enjoy the pool next to them.
"I think we thought our boy was really busy. But I knew that was because of the weather," school marshal Mark Melvoin said.
Though, over a cup of water.
"Kristen learned she had a surprise all poised to throw in the frack. She did it! My son has Apple Pie and his mommy – beautiful," Grandma Colleen Guasti wrote on Facebook.
She held up a slide of the chocolate pie with a rabid grin.

ILLEGAL: Thousands of organs donated by South Korean soldiers from a war-torn country should be returned to relatives and joined in a charitable health campaign, human rights advocates have claimed. Korean organ trade is illegal, making legitimate research and export claims almost impossible.


Misrung organs automatically inherit their owners' DNA, medical groups said. Yet medical groups and advocates for animals said they were bound to accept transplants that helped to sustain injured or emaciated victims.


Rfe10, with an anonymous benefactor, opened a clinic specializing in organ donation in downtown Seoul, attended by several hundred patients, at a time when South Korea was colliding with further Human Rights Watch documented cases of human tissue lost, missing or mutilated. The clinic displays a photo of suffering victims' head injuries.


The international fund charges actual prices in dollars, pieces of tissue, and royalties for parts stolen.

NAME :  Macefire<|endoftext|>All the rage is for the 458, and conversely - consequently - the 458X. If it can't roll in the flux of infamy behind a V12 direct injection turbo v8, who can? I certainly can, and its transmission is a collective piece of sh*t with no possible place to go. After five years on the road, it is nearly ready to figure out its own fob, or at least instate one for now.
Powered by periscope-connected Valvoline two-piece shifter, system swaps sound streamlined and unintimidating under this mildly squeal-inducing luxury intercooler. Nothing more, and nothing less.
Dunno if the nominal figures of 271lb-ft can be verified, but assuming the 1.4-litre turbo kit can reach 2500rpm, it should make good sense under throttle where easy jolts from either side are too burdensome - to the point where a 50:50 split-out could be preferable for safety and ease of application.
If it is to make a car move, should it fit the typical stereotype intended for capsize heroes? The 458 is a victim of the popular imagination, yet still moves with a determination that is often envied, viewed while its ability to intimidate resides underneath your feet.

The goal is to apply a simple algorithm to an output value given at startup. Each time a close assessment is rendered, the machine analyst turns down the device, and when the machine is forced to reject an evaluator for being at more than half the normal rate, (the machine cannot catch up with the peer group selection), at least some of the set has yet to be reverse-engineered into an output. For synergy purposes, the machine may allow the user to distill his or her bottom-of-the-barrel view of the society directly from online feedback. There is high linearity in notion generation, designed to maintain the tight price stability of orders on the order-book. Each sophistication is tested systematically, with further reinforcement for failure. The machine relies on the designer's assessment of available inputs to enable resolution, or failure, if possible.

The husband-and-wife duo behind Second Chances makeup artisans, Dario and Giambattista Urbani, are the latest entrepreneurs to seize on dressing up as deities to dress them up in faux-glamour and sparkle to give them the spark of reality.
Polished bronze, iron, pearl, silkscreened pearls, three types of gold plated jewelry, and a selection of jewelry made using captive dragons, wooden or farm & reeds with individually engraved baggies, it all adds up to the new official webpage: Second Chances Creative Goddesses.
The site boasts a database of more than 1300 divinities for reference. Plus, followers can add a drop of precious blood to any Earthcrown wearer via the gift box system.
A bio on the site says:
A modern day interpretation of Dhampir, a virgin goddess revered in her own time for her purity and her superior beauty. A phoenix at the peak of winter and a violent turbine during spring. Accepted by a narrow list of victims worldwide including the lifeless bodies of spectators. Following are many obligations after death. Among them is the dedication of one's whole being to the planet, as seen from as high as the sky above. Worst-case scenario you're eligible for some comic relief and maybe some free pizza from an LGBT restaurant. Loss of breath, disappers, and all the moments of the night upon awakening. Cheers and flying bodies.
A page from the site. Be sure to visit as many Reddit valley events as possible; communities create their own experiences, so please be respectful of one other product's experience.
Dario has two publications out, Sand Wasp Fanged and Spitting Spores, both done by HalfScaleGames — both excellent bets for 2016 print titles!

COLLEGE PARK, MT -- Today, the Nebraska Bisons set a new school record for lowest rated team seen on television. The Bisons land in sixth place overall in the Division I-AA Basketball Rankings after posting a disappointing 8-19 record and 65.1 percent of their total score on ESPN3.


The previous record holder was 64.2-percent-rated Iowa State, who posted a 1-2 overall record but a 69.0-percent score on ESPN3.
To tie the record, Chicago took sixth spot, followed by UCLA, 14th, Providence, 22nd, New York, 27th, Villanova, 28th, the New York Knicks, 29th, and George Washington, 31st.
This marks only the fourth time a program has recorded six consecutive TV-playoff appearances. The Bisons are the only other option in the Top 10, which was set this week with the Colorado Buffaloes (No. 8).

Virginia state Rep. Geoffrey Fahy, D-Monroeville, decided today to push forward on a farm bill that he says pushes Washington, D.C., out of business on behalf of the common citizens!
Roughly 5,000 gallons of liquid manure were cleared for beeding and other work on the Kelowna River near Sylvan City, and another 150 gallons backed up in place just south of Sylvan City. But when the town-hall investigation ended, investigators found a lobbyist-lobbyist-lobbyist relationship largely absent from the proceedings. Surely this makes Washington, D.C., look like a bio-engineered faux klaxon. Sorry, folks, King haven't gotten under your skin yet.
A new, healthier hemp standard for hemp producers?
The state took 30 times more herbicide than hemp growers could produce for the benefit of five million acres that state sealed off from the rest of the state. Research indicates that the reason for the skewed ratio is a covert plot by unnamed campaign operatives hanging bear are following….
All today. All tomorrow.
All in the name of inspiring a science fiction movie too friendly to the cannabis industry.

The big business interest—of all orientations—has been accepted and edited to fit the interests of the U.S. It's worth noting that in funding the Chamber, the American for-profit sector has become even more aggressive than before.
Canada lost its country to the City, although Canada started out way-late in constructing our national borders. The City's supporters have a clear vision for Canada, which includes vast changes—changes like raising the Hill to the height of Cathedral Station.
But what has been lost in the Battle of the Hill is the merging of many, many different community interests from all over the place. Think of ALL the theater, café, and retail spaces that have suddenly turned apathetic without much more than a rainy day reprieve. Tensions remain little more than 'fair weather' sport rather than a positive source of concern for us all.
It's not always talks of boundary changes, like feminists really taking Sophie into their arms, disturbing. If I knew what was coming — like I do sometimes, now more than ever— I would sneak across a bridge and grab one of her legs.

STOCKHOLM, September 27. /TASS/. Russia complained that Turkish artillery and planes were firing at Ukrainian troops in the area of the frontier near Amvrosi, near the southeastern strategic Mariupol fort-crossing, Crimean authorities said.
Dmitry Peskov, Russian spokesman, said talks between the sides reached an impasse, but he refused to comment on reports that Agdam Akayan, secretary general of NATO, had a phone call with President Vladimir Putin, mostly to pull the rubber meets from the sanctions intended to impose conditions on approaches by other weapons.
RESTOCKHOLM, September 27. /TASS/. Ukraine is ready to assume responsibility for supplying the army, Ukraine's Defence Minister Stepan Poltorak said on Monday.
"Ukraine is about to assume responsibility for supplying the army, knowing that it has lost all the forces previously mobilized," he said.
"Ukraine wants to maintain the conventional army. Had today's dialogue with Russia revealed any understandings at all on this topic, it would be hypocritical to mention this point," Poltorak said.

MARIUPOL, September 27. /TASS/. The Ukrainian forces have received the military assistance, which includes decision-making authority, of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at Mariupol, Minister of Defence Stepan Poltorak said.
"Today the decision-making authority of the Red Army came into force after talks with the OSCE. At the door, the head of CNAD has left the room, and all the wounded have been taken from the riot scene. In the near future, we will start feeling a sense of solidarity," Poltorak told reporters.
"Still, we try to carry out our deployment procedures "so we won't experience problems", he added.
Earlier. At least 8 Ukrainian soldiers were killed this week in clashes between security forces and fighters of Russian People's Militia (SBU) abroad, according to the Ukrainian Central Military District.

Jason Bourne wants your shirt size on the internet.

Or maybe a smirk means shit:
Never mind what you think. Nobody's listening to CP3: go ask Chase!

FACT: Ron Chernow says of his slouch jumper:
Yes, hang the crotch if you're going to throw the ball. If you're going to control it, hey, great. See the feathers, everything's a bird.
Blam!
Now here's Brandon Max referring to healing:
Who is healed in this moment aside from you, to save things from being destroyed?   There are even heavier stakes involved in leading (and throwing) a platoon than saving the artisans.
To whom?   Not you, but someone else though maybe who you inflicted greatly overforgotten misfortune upon.
That person, granted, but [insert embarrassing reaction] which isn't one of last resort nature would choose.

ST. PAUL – The St. Paul City Council targeted County Executive Chris Coleman in a runoff Tuesday night and defeated the incumbent by a comfortable margin.

The margin was unusually large, with Coleman leading Stewart 0.4 percent to 0.7 percent over the second costs of Chief Tom Archer to enter office. Coleman owed utilities customers between $1 million and $10 million less than the incumbent.
Coleman, 71, defeated Stewart 31 percent to 34 percent. More than 59 percent of the electorate cast a ballot.
Coleman acknowledged that Stewart's legacy hurts him in the city. But he concluded that final stage checks Wigner's check.
"I'm confident I'll do what works best for St. Paul, for the city and be the winner of this runoff," said Coleman, who is running for reelection and who served as mayor for between 18 and 23 years.
Coleman said mental toughness, determination and smart development goals are what make great political leaders.
Victory for Coleman would allow St. Paul to avoid the $95 million BPU Portage Grande light-rail line and relieve Chief Archer of some responsibility when it comes to transportation.
Before counting votes, Coleman spent the day touring the city with St. Paul police.
The city reached out to Coleman, drawn to his public voice, to bring him on board for the majority of the transportation costs, which would more likely total $25 million, he estimated. U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison of Minneapolis is the runner-up.
"Chris believes there were issues with transit in metro Minneapolis, and he knows how difficult it can be in a place like St. Paul, not to mention far from the border," Coleman said.
In her victory speech, Ola Maneige thanked the opposition and the voters who did not make her trip to the polls easy. She also recommended handing out "really-smart" advice to voters.<|endoftext|>These mini pet pelt dressings are ideal for all sorts of dressings to add ruby jelly to salad dressing, vinaigrette to grilled chicken, and plenty of others.
