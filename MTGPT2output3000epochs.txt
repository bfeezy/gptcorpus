======================================== SAMPLE 5 ========================================
WILLIAMSON VALLEY, Kan. — A helicopter crashed into a corn field in Willson, wearing lights on its wings as part of a federal grant to keep criminals out of Kansas.
The mystery of the incident kept the townspeople from venturing out before dusk.
But soon after dark, human footprints were discovered near a cornfield, linking them to investigators headed for the crash site.
Once authorities announced it belonged to "the savages" who killed four people, locals were intrigued, thinking another disaster had just taken place.
Less than a week after the crash, the camera was turned off, the lights were turned off and the helicopter was powered off.
Then came word that the state had granted a $100 million federal grant to Keep Brothers Hall, a building where dozens of Kansas University students are housed on its fourth floor.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.—The Wichita Eagle recently reported on a new Kansas grant for a federal highway maintenance loan program. Some say the grant will buy vital road repairs, even in state-owned farmland. Others say the grants ultimately won't get spent. And when the public figures are any kind of experts, there's always the always-more-savages-in-the-miststrands formula.
Other than former governor Mike Pence, who won a CNN Money reputation for threatening to fire down a helicopter on protestors, neither Mike Pence nor Kansas Republican Governor Sam Brownback has portrayed the tragedy as a tragedy. This time they avoided blaming the ACLU for not "expressing" their objection faster, presumably in anticipation that it would happen before funny peoplecame home with pizza.
So fraudsters pretending to be a state representative and sending him out on even-handed, predictable coptic attacking the Montessori school, like what happened to Mike Pence, is indicative of distrust in both the state government and legislators.
Marcella Tumbra, a postdoc at the orm Research Institute of Open Source Technology, tells the ceramics Global Windows blog that dozens more balloons appear in her images every hour. She needs to settle on location to explore it.

April 3, 2000 - It's actually proper baseball.

The Astros were 2 for 4 and leading 1-0 in the fourth when Steve Pearce slid into second. Mickey Mantle swung at an instruction slide and sailed it hopelessly through for Andrews Pinfield to score Cy Young with 77.

The Astros started 7 for 10 in the third, taking 136 of their 171 total costs into the diversion. Erik Burkhardt led off the frame with his only hit.
Garrett Taylor lined a 2-2 pitch to center and Tom Hackett closed down with his only homer of the night.

Umberto Eco published "Between the World" in 1923, when he was thirty-two, and became known as a master of eroticistic prose: "There is no room in the skin for a strange reading of books, or for an entirely abstract thought."
THE MYSTIC GREAT SAKE
I dare say no one knows what to make of the Magical Great Seed. No one knows why it was transformed into an Amulet or why it was protected. No one knows how to consume it, or how to destroy it. If it bends when sliced, that's a good sign, and a source of hope. If it doesn't -- well, that says something about our better judgment, but that's another problem entirely.

One of America's leading clinical psychologists, Dr Bottyn Molloy, has been awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The 74-year-old university professor shares tidbits of wisdom gleaned under the bright lights of a Nobel prize workshop like a pastor sharing a sermon about the Lord's Supper with his parishioners in the pouring rain.


Born in Edinburgh in 1932, Molloy studied at University College Cork's Cognitive Neurology Unit and Trinity College Dublin's School of Behavioral Medicine. He has been awarded the University's Victoria Cross and the Public Health Medal for the 1950s and 1960s.


Molloy holds the Scot Snell Lifetime Achievement Award and double distinction of being named one of the Index of Physiological Excellence and the Royal Society of Edinburgh's Professor of Psychology Award of the Year 2012.


Thanks to the son of squishers and a champion surfer, Bottyn Molloy is born about six feet tall.<|endoftext|>On Monday, Amy Schumer released a series of short videos, filling the internet with examples of some of the controversial Trump from the president's early days in office.

"I affectionately call these iLikeSenorshitdonalds who the politician's actually 'heard' Trump say and is taking offense."

DUBLIN, Maine — Plainview, a resource management firm that works with Native groups in Maine, says there is hardly any state law that forbids selling mounts of cattle to someone asking to own the animals.
The company will come into a store on Friday, Sept. 1, and ask the counter clerk to display them for a fee.
"Right now, we have staff whose job is to call the various county offices and station a ranger, and we are not required to comply at this time," assistant vice president of communication and lobbying Barbara Lynch said Friday. "The caveat is that the sale of those items may not fall within the case history and bond requirement for selling an animal [which previously would be stalled]."
Sue Lynn, an assistant manager with two years of service, told the store clerk she and her staff were from the bureau of animal laws. The clerk informed them there was no state law that prohibits these items being sold for resale, Lynne said.
The clerk then replied to Lynn: "All right," Lynn said she said, "but why would I need these pictures right now?"
Lynn said the clerk was clueless.
"A good clerk, right?" Lynn asked.
The clerk paused.
"There is no law banning getting images of yourself on these sales," she said.
Lynn said sales aren't limited to goats and sheep.<|endoftext|>Khaytan, Lady of Abandoned Places,

In March 2016, Adobe announced plans to shut down Adobe Creative Cloud in 2017. The Stop Sales process has been extended through June 2017.
Read an in-depth article about the Stop Sales process »
← Step into the Creative Cloud >
At GDC 2016 earlier this year, Adobe announced that all Adobe licenses would be revoked through bigoted misuse. Adobe Creative Cloud users reported a situation where Adobe had installed a third-party application on their machines that deceived them into installing it on an earlier version of Adobe Creative Cloud.
Adobe ended up closing a short period of its developer ecosystem that included Adobe Creative Cloud. But not directly. It did happen to become available online for purchase (with much higher licensing fees since they were removing all those archaic license fees).
Some press reports on the discontinuation of Adobe Creative Cloud include:
"Adobe Draw hadn't made any great leaps in its first 20 months. Why stop now?"—Lizzie Moschowitz, Motherboard—"Adobe admitted in plain language it wasn't really stopping. It just was."—Chris Welch, Retort
One exchange in particular stands out even though they were discussing a different thing: A rebuttal of Gerd Vitthaus' defense of Adobe against Gerd Vitthaus' attack.

Player Character Details

After this one you have three simple decisions:
Cost to rebuild, damage to rebuild, or damage upgraded?
What options?
Rebuild costs 3B and damage to rebuild costs 1. Can I rebuild just above a target or do I have to suffer that +1/+1 counter penalty?
As you continue your exploration of your deck, use one of the following precepts to further understand your prey:
Always attack: Creatures that have not attacked you this turn have total power and toughness 1/1.
Keep an eye on the battlefield: Creatures without flying live and breathe and are treated as though they had flying until your creatures are attacked.
Emperor's Watch: Creatures have vigilance and indestructible.
At this point in the game, you have many ways to choose to treat emperor's watch creatures.
Are child-rearing and offspring skills equal on the battlefield? You decide.
Does city life approach death equally? As you increase in power, choose carefully.

The nerdy demographic behind even the most outlandish online campaigns is mostly for jerks, according to a clothing line full of giant ugly chicks.

Online Fashionistas are too all-encompassing to let one person handle their obsession, Lana Tan vilesomacakate wrote on his blog this week.
"Anybody can get into a bunch of threads and start building themselves a mess while collecting ideas. We want people to get inspired."
The leader of the following thread is entitled "What is the worst thing that can happen?"

Well. Yes. There certainly are.
For example, if one woman wrote: "Don't double down on getting your tits ring stuck in your purse," one man would reply: "How about: …"

a "I've never gotten accused of rape in my life," a cry of outrage from the other asked. "So no!" "And. Why?" a man asked. A few seconds of silence. "My hubby looks in the mirrors sometimes," the man replied.
KIRK: "Kirk – this station takes seventeen minutes to lap. If you drank ten gallons of milk right now and didn't launch yourself into space, what would you do?"

ROCK HILLS, N.C.—Nathan Compton knows winged horses are nothing new to his life.

But the second-seeded Carolina Coast is far from the first team to land land-based mudcrabs.

Glenn Poole and his crew took a second-person perspective when they rescued a homeless couple from a trailer in this week's U.S. Open.

They later helped when the brushless flight-partner rocketed over a built-up area.

CLOSE Protesters across the country took to the streets on Friday to rage at Trump's declaration of martial law in Texas. VPC

Phoenix — Some protestors have the right to ignore Trump's annual State of the Union address Thursday.

The one-sentence speech is the Trump's signature message to Congress. In the presidential address he delivers to Congress, Trump rarely uses remarks or words from his text, instead reading a set of guidelines about what to keep in mind and from what, as advice.

After nearly 500 supporters (and several police officers), Doral Police Officer Bryan LaRosa was outnumbered twice by protesters.
LaRosa saw the lecterns rise from their seats where Trump was speaking.
"I guess they didn't want to interrupt when he was actually speaking," he recalled.

Rebecca Lobo, a partner at Washington, D.C.-based law firm Urbi Services and former IRS official who works on political communications campaigns, told USA TODAY, "About three or four months ago the FEC changed the rules governing the amount a political organization could accept to participate in an election. Now, organizations are permitted to receive up to $2,437 in one contribution per donor per election cycle. At current donation levels, I wouldn't see this Rule going into effect."

The practice of allowing individuals to give up to $2,437 to potentially or evolved cause People to initiate a larger than usual donation each election cycle? $2,437, put differently, is not a small amount. That's conservatively $2.5 million. You guys. 1.8 million people contributed to a 'Grand Slam' win at the Congressional Baseball Classic by spending another $1 million on pinstripes. Now your home committee wins $2 million, then you get up to $2 million. 2.5 million came at $3 millions.
But wait. Haven't you heard, men, that there are things $2,437 would NOT buy anymore? The beauty of advertising, ads. . . billboards. . . every park to fit every fan's need for teenage girl hotness. . . figurines of every baseball team owned by CEO James Rusk, solely owned by President Rusk. But wait. . . oh wait, nothing says "love" like a gigantic cardboard mass of money. No crime. 4th tier scar scars.
Advertise within your agency. The greatest magic of persuasion is most effective when unsuspecting mortals are duped by b-voters. Or, to use e-mail masquerading as governmental email, used as cover for corporate spoliation. Advertise everywhere, Television Industry Association radio ads graciously director of RR's media liaison, Tammy Larson . . . soaps, boast posters, folk songs, racquet ballmelons, park benches, ball pit brushes . . .

By now every schmuck on the Seventh Ridge, including myself, had seen the first wave of My Excellency's showers.
I started arguing with Grigsby for the millionth time when HE extended his body from within and seized mine.
Case 11: Stupid Secrets
It sounded like My Excellency was planning to inflict some kind of combat damage on me.
I didn't think there was any loyalty beyond blocking his sexual advances.
Case 12: Galumphing around

One day, you will watch as a traitor's spirit binds you to that murderer's body as your soul passes out. That such a momentous sin will be etched in your remembered history is a particular shame.

I'm really excited about how the criminal case has unfolded. I'm guessing those guilty are dead, even if they didn't intend for it.
Video games have become so valuable. This sordid tale plays into their hands, what with poor druidimages being national treasures in the eyes of these evil conspiring witches.
I really hope this reads like a scary opus or two from the perps. I like to think of them as victims who got away with murdering innocent people only they didn't consider sorry enough.

LOS ANGELES — The Columbus Blue Jackets have recalled defenseman Tom Sestito off Columbus' injured reserve list.
The club announced the move on its official website.
Sestito, 28, has registered six points (three goals, five assists) in 44 career NHL games and 58 points (32 goals, 49 assists) in 116 career AHL games. Last season, he recorded career-high 72 points (44 goals, 56 assists).
In addition to his experience in professional sports, Sestito also skated in the AHL's Providence Bruins, scoring three goals. In 215 career NHL games, he has 196 points (58 goals, 86 assists).
The team's roster now stands at 82 players.
The blue and whites begin their preseason schedule on Wednesday, October 4 against Detroit. Columbus will play eight consecutive games, highlighted by Tuesday, October 9 at Columbus.<|endoftext|>Guest post by Dave Haveman!

Todd Nelson reports that David Roach took over Chief Executive Officer after Danica Leadsom resigned and stated that no formal reasons were given for wanting him to return. Todd quotes a source as saying that the company will be a "success" for wealthy benefactors of the Finnish cooperatives industry – and in particular those as generous as the Finkells.
While investment in these kind of green initiatives is largely limited to libertarians – those who want to benefit from lots of free money that will result in other premises profitably being harmed – it is clear that they exist as well among the 5% of us who want nothing less than complete and total destruction of our fellow man.
Yes, there are also quite a few on the left who believe the Finkells to be amazing on many levels.
Here is a quotation from a website run by a relinquished rat named DonnaNotes dramatically titled I am not leaving my house, I am not leaving my flamethrower, I am not leaving my bathrobe, I am not leaving my firearms/hoax detectors/pretext warning keys/car keys, I am not exiting my car:
DonnaNotes
If the remains of your fleeing pursuer are too heap-thick for your dissolving crusader to reach thusly, hole up in your home until you are at least 50% through your homemaker.
For a cost I do not know of, listen to your son and teach him not to burst in when you are done, so you can now expand your sneak-attack network with impunity.
Glad to hear that!
Erica Georgiou claims this school has helped her graduate third from third, lower than 13th from 13th. It is true that she went from being sixth from sixth at 7th grade to being 16th from 16th at 9th grade. An eighth to 11th grader from 12th grade is just about the enemy you wish to ignore.
My concerns, though trivial, would be minor. I don't see how they improve the curriculum. This fits into the problem of Focus Day students mastering a single faculty but doing great work only after graduating and logging their prestige talk in a New Grade column for the Parents & Like-Minded.
NB: I think she means "index 01 name" to mean that test scores reflect "earned" experience. I was looking for more subtle implicit solutions like this one.
For some reason the seminar on hypocrisy begins with Cohen's concern that This Letter Will Strike a Sadistic Blow Against the Right to Keep and Bear Arms "Given more exercise, we shall find room for a doubt, for a good idea, for a good conscience and—well, banged on wood … Come now, Capri! Come now, battery, set some chairs all around the dais for melancholy." (I think Golombrov wisely caps Scripture volumes in Venus Cauterices.) In case you missed the moral "Don't say It Doesn't Haunt You"

For Keith's Take
Yehuda was chosen in the fourth round (No. 82) of the 1981 Draft while Fullmer struggled for many years behind the bench. Ramon Villa was an impressive player as a freshman, but his 19 goals were gradually followed up by six goals and 11 points last season. Both were outstanding performances for PEJCA, but Fullmer seen enough performances from Otherland Monks and went undrafted.
Marcia Katz loves to play.
Sean begrudgingly chose himself.
Pierre acknowledges the choice is the real hard one.

With just over three weeks until Iowa and New Hampshire primary voters meet in Iowa City, the latest results come after a six-month period in which only Republican polls indicated Clinton's dominant position.
Clinton received 48 percent support to 22 percent support for Trump, six points personal percent and 34 points for third-party candidates. Libertarian Gary Johnson garnered 6 percent, 1 percent, and 3 percent support, respectively, according to the survey.
The poll, conducted between Dec. 4-6 and has a 3-point margin of error North Dakota.
According to the Des Moines Register, 26 percent of all respondents said they would be more likely to support the soon-to-be-elected presidential candidate rather than Libertarian Richard Nixon in 1968. Among that group, a third were to stay home in the forseeable future if the presidential race drops precipitously as analysts expected it to.
When asked how likely they thought the creation of Syrian refugee camps would be, 55 percent of those who responded were more likely to support Clinton's proposals on the ground, 32 percent of those plans were more likely to be supported indirectly, while only 3 percent of all respondents thought the Clinton plan would be equivalent in likelihood of working.
Among Democrats, 39 percent of those who responded are more likely to support Clinton, while 35 percent of those who said these same things were more likely to support Trump.
In keeping with other polls over recent weeks, 58 percent of Republicans were more likely than Democrats to support Clinton, while 58 percent of independents were more likely to support Trump.
As recently as last month, 38 percent of all respondents said they are more likely to vote for a third-party presidential candidate than vote for Clinton. The average percentage reduction in the election is 3.6 percentage points, according to the Quinnipiac University poll.<|endoftext|>The Federal Reserve's December speech on the causes of sluggish economic growth suggested that the central bank had warmed to the idea that employment remains an important driver of its output mix. But with inflation still above target, the Fed has recently reverted to zero inflation.
In October, the Fed noticed:
The December 2015 median forecast for the federal funds rate came in at 0.25 percent. This rate of policy standoff was not unusual. In fact, the median forecast in all future five-year forecasts in November 2015 was within some units of 1, even as the Fed's target rate was unchanged.
The Fed's figures, which are typically higher in real terms than the figures published in press releases, provide no context for the themes of the speech.
They maintained that even though the unemployment rate remains unusually low, "current public demand is generally stronger than at any point in the recent working period."
The Fed's four main methods of producing implied inflation—proposed in its October policy statement—did not participate in this hypothetical case, providing few clues the speech's authors did not anticipate.
Hayward: The impersonal bidding competition producing exclusively mysterious growth
Specifically on the causal scenario, only this seventh step, along with more than 300 other estimates, were included:
The monetary policy pursued by the Federal Reserve has tended to tighten the credit conditions on households and firms.
The supports for monetary stimulus in the economy exist principally as a result of higher levels of minutes market participants pay for short-term contracts, as well as third-party securities.
The overall balance of evidence does not speak of a particular, or even a significant, effect of liquidity on economic performance

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- Running backs coach Matt Luke wasn't an obvious choice for Atlanta's head coaching job after the Falcons' monumental 8-8 season in 2013.

But as training camp has dragged on, Luke has remarkably turned around the team's backfield. The Falcons have averaged 5.6 yards per carry in the past three weeks, and six of those players combined for 159 yards and three touchdowns during their upcoming seven-game winless streak.

"Matt's done an unbelievable job of cutting down on the time of day [that players] are out there practicing," one running back told L.A. Weekly. "That noise pack helps really, really."

But Luke was determined not to speculate about who won't ever work for him again.

"Eric Reid has unfortunately passed," this writer said. "Something of a legend."

Here are three men who would you rather see playing a season's worth of snaps alongside fellow undrafted free agents Devonta Freeman and James Wilder: Mike Vrabel, Ryan Mathews and Matt Aldrich.

The first seasons of Seinfeld and The Pearl were hailed as groundbreaking television, credited with turning many television shows on their ear.

But because the first seasons were also thought to be great comedies, Fey and her co-star Jerry Seinfeld were in the red for many years.

Fey's Caring laughs turned off millions of Seinfeld fans, even though she joked in many songs.

Now, a French band has immortalised the famous serenade as a delightful song — a delightful sound by which daughters and wives would love to succeed each other.

Introduction
Well here we go again. This week I'm going to talk about the noise deterrent provided by them.


When I was the Brian Distinguished Professor of Weather, Urban Design, and Environmental Science, we had the unfortunate experience of designing the DuPage Box to take place in the Houston Ship Channel. Naturally, we thought we were doing a good job of creating a practical and claustrophobic object, and it should begin to appear that way soon.


When I started writing this article, I had no idea how Tulan, Vincent's Evil Twin Ge-Skill, would react to seeing it on television. Of course, I'd already prepared Sandy Blanchard for it—
"You mean you can see it?"
"Ah, yes. I thought you couldn't."
"Oh?" She puffed and tapped her foot, "-so."


And so began the story of the "Sandy Blanchard Planetside Plushie."

Steve Malitz, whose company makes ships, golf swings and drinking fountains, thinks the M13 escalator has been vandalized twice already.
SAN FRANCISCO — As replacements for old objects become available, his Austin, Tex., firm M13 escalator replacement competitors show up with more ideas to replace it with.
The U.S. Department of Transportation this month warned the Austrian firm was putting six more products-to-replace M13 escalators under the spotlight, including a tread pitch for golf clubs and a pump for drinking fountains — just in time for the annual September meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
Yes, there are six other members of the Automotive Materials Innovation Foundation committee of which . . . you guessed it . . . some items.
One of the names: a "sterile drain" for flatscreen TVs.
"Some freaking quartz TV transplant!" said John Shipley, the group's president. "Stop it! Please. Stop it!"
Other imports included an electronic stereo switcher and an improvement on a Krok stopped long enough to do 'fresso"-style damage.
"Snivel," Shipley added, annoyed as usual.
Our favorite substitution? A toilet seat for 4-year-olds.
"A toilet seat for 4-year-olds is such a great idea," said Ben Wheaton, executive director of the teachers' association. "I will use some of those bacteria (decontaminate, disinfect) machines."
Sorry, Ben, 'Cause you're ranting about 'risks.'"

Cloud 9, the studio behind Demon's Souls, has created a group of new enemies for Demon's Souls 3. One unearthly newcomer stands out: a woman named Carmen.
Last night, I was watching a livestream of the Overwatch event when we were introduced to the new heroes Roxas and Kharazim. The two were instantly rivals, with Kharazim quickly breaking out a message, 'I promise to grow stronger every day.'
At the same time as the two heroes made introductions, a female voice asked something of Roxas: 'Is this your first mob offline?'
Xofia Regina Ernst
Lucy blessed the announcer and asked ask's again: 'Is this your first offline mob offline?'
Roxas answered: 'Yeah, I was in a local with my friend Kel'Thuzad and he said it was the first mob offline, so we went.'
Lucy ran her hand down her body and smiled broadly: 'Oh, really? So this is a first?'
Lucy laughed, too, 'Yeah, I started playing mob of the gods before I ever met Chromie, didn't I?'
Xofia took a deep breath: 'Yeah, it sounds so awesome, I couldn't let it slide!'
While these indie developers are making a game, these Nintendo employees are writing special scenarios using special in-game mechanics.
Lucy said: 'I'm really excited to find out how the game ends, so it will be really long before I get to meet everyone.'

Coins to be auctioned off amid Tuesday deadline for fallout over Panama Papers

Plans are under way to auction off photos then delete them
At least 70 pages from Panama Papers that appear to relate to the founder of Panamanian real estate group Mossack Fonseca have been purloined by "stakeholders" who deny wrongdoing, Kimberly Dozier, a spokeswoman for Tierney, filed online on Monday.


Her filing says only 48 pages were removed to obtain the "correctated" version of the Panama Papers, which were first published by the Associated Press. The files have now been downloaded more than a million times.
But the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists has published a deluge of documents from nearly 200 law firms involved in tax, accounting, and offshore matters.
In one clear indication of the worldwide media's interest in the saga, McDermott, Will & Emery said it was taking deposits of $100m (£63m) starting on 11 March, without revealing how much it was willing to offer.
They have rung the bell, suggesting to potential buyers that there is no time for waiting.
Dozier added: "At 9am on 15 March, we will send approval notices to all bidders for tax reasons, auditing and opt out."
Within eight minutes of the news on Monday the website and Stock Exchange were awash with "stakeholder" bids, including CryptoCompare, Buckingham Laurel, Mixed Business Observer, Cookie Kloten, Urviso, D49212, Facepunch, Front-End

From 7 March, Dow Jones informed media outlets it would no longer report "synergistic news" about the stock market.
From 7-11 March, WorldPost requested comment from Dosa Petrobras Pte Ltd. but nearly three hours after the request was made many a customer left a comment complaining of poor service. The firm's Twitter feed declared "Re: PR Firm Concerns – PardulamNet and Id Gwa Agan Decay". So proper.
Cloud Hide Pacifist
Dosa, the largest online collecting business of the internet, urged its users to store valuable information about themselves in content cloud stores. This comprises "up to 600GB of files" and includes "internet banking receivables." Shareholders can distribute such items in one of "several favorite ways by email, message boards or just hang them in your house."
David Linebrink, president and CEO, SourceForge, wrote on its blog: "Cloud Hide Pacifist is on the verge of its grand finale, and it's changing my world. From now on, When You Go Somebody's going To Come."
Cloud Hide Pacifist called upon anyone who wanted to "talk to me in person" – or off-line – to do so. It states "We suppose you cannot communicate with us directly, but we will always have someone to talk to." Don't expect them to answer back.
From 7 March, the Institute for Humane Studies said on its website that it had a discussion on the global battle against child poverty, but that members were still prohibited from mentioning the Panama Papers.
Justin Kirchrack, a spokesperson for Godwin's Law Laboratories, advised members in a letter to avoid generating the words "I hate this" or "they really do care."
Apple Worldwide Developers Conference advisory board members are distilled from 239 people. Dhaka University professor TanRi Thann said much of the University's urban villages were given the newly formed section on diversity to encourage sustainability and social inclusion because many prospective business students were from Shanghai.
Apart from a small number of workshops, Jamia Aida, a prominent charity working with donors from Mauritius to India, tried to donate 14 yuan (49 grams) of tea at the 10 March gala.

The video condemns the tragedy as a terrorist attack, says she's faced them before

(CNN) Take Jimmy Lee Dunbar for example. His 30-minute voice on the 911 radio about two men slitting the throat of a young boy off the side of a Manhattan townhouse before brutally stabbing and killing a TSA official merely doesn't go down well on the wrong side of the law.

A police principal who'e been ripping out every hair on Jimmy's voluptuous frame, County High School teacher Monty Valdee announced she was calling off the wait-and-see approach to the horrific bloodshed.

And then he broadcast, screaming, "Timeline: Begin immediately the process of taking us all out of here!"

Lynch was seated in her cabin in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, listening to the authoritative outpouring of emotion done Tuesday evening.

The eerie question atop the Tel Aviv cast announced its pronouns during Wednesday's ceremony.

After taking up a microphone that had been surgically removed from Jimmy's arm , voiceover professor Monty Valdee said, "Time to blow you guys," played it out, and he squirmed inside some baby doll-sized syringe.

Valdee complied only after Jim's family and friends -- no hysterics, no crying -- listened

PostgreSQL 2.1.2 binary archives have been migrated to stabilized TapeDB. These binaries have fixes for a previously reported crash on 64 bit Windows, SRP support for indicate lengths for long string operations, and a new contrib.sqlite module that sets the proper table name. There are no changes to execution engines.

THE STRUGGLE FOR NOTICERS: The Russian Network For Homeland Security And Civil Liberties Has Shifted Its Enforcing Tactics To Attack Hardline Views Of Government

The Russian Federation Network For Homeland Security and Civil Liberties, a state-owned organization established in 1996, has shifted its methods in pursuing the Russian Federation compliance plans.

Round-the-clock surveillance is crucial and the plan takes into account the so-called 'hell' aspect of regions</p> <br><br> Regards, Semenya Savchina <[email protected]>.— RUSSIAN Fed/RUSSIA (@REG_RUSSIAN) December 5, 2014

MOSCOW, Dec. 5 (RAPSI) – Regime change in the Russian Federation is nothing new. Or, at least, not for the last decade or so.
Three years ago, Luzhliv Kityakin brought his expertise to Davos with a highly publicized call for protests in Davos Square. In an extraordinary op-ed in the Russian state-owned Rossiiskaya Gazeta, Kityakin, the director general of the Russian Federal Service for Migration and Refugees, wrote that people in the urban areas of Moscow and St. Petersburg "are tormented by high unemployment and high crime, with dramatic increased re-entry smuggling to the country." Why would the Russian oligarch or politician want to see those things on the morning news?
Kityakin also warned that his country's citizens involved in regular protests could face tougher consequences, including appearances in the Heydar Aliyev Detention Center at Tatarstan Prison.

Verse (Click for Chapter)


Don't worship the nightmares, for everything lurks in the shadows.And don't worship the vampires, for they are many, and they are hungry, and they are thirsting.And don't worship the fiends, for they are many, and they are hungry, and they are thirsty.And don't worship the old gods, for they are many, and they are thirsty, and they are raging in the dark.And don't worship Phoebus, for he spared the lives of his picking crew, all he ever saw in the shape of hogshead was slag and badger.And don't worship Shu, for he spared the lives of his cornfields, all he ever felt was "FUCK THE SVILLEGOOSE" Let them serve the fallen, for their bloody deaths are nought but the beginning of better days to come.For they anchored on shore, and they gave naught but death to the sea.Unless they led to death Then the sea no longer would hold them still;They anchored on shore, and now their awaits are Death and nothing more.And don't worship the morning, for none have eyes to see the good day.And don't worship the dead, for there is no resurrection among the living.And don't worship the day, for beginning of the evening is far off, even to the setting Sun.And don't worship the dead, for there is no resurrection among the living.
Proverbs 11:17-18; Psalms 118:2-4; Ezekiel 10:6-7
Verse (Click for Chapter)


Don't you take a single soul back home, all those with wings and wings of darkness
Don't you take a single soul back home, all those caught in darkness
Don't take a single soul home
Turn the shadows to hatred, paint their eyes to blood*
Don't you take a single soul home, all shadows extinguished.
Don't take a single soul home.
Turn the shadows to blood and paint their eyes to cup.
Don't take a single soul home
Turn the darkness to dust, and leave the torch in the night.
Ye shall all pass through, without stench or breath of the devil;
Yea, with tears and lamentations, without blasphemies with wailing children.
Breed clean out of purity, into the house of prayer and mercy and death devotion.
As Jon Snow steered his ship eastward, he stopped abruptly.In front of him, the shipyard pushed skyward in laughter.Spreads the old prayer over the piers, turning the old demons to stone.Old gods of shipbuilding, false gods of shipbuilding.They serve no one, they serve only the wind.They serve no principle, they serve only the wind.To be a shipyard was to be skilled in the art of transforming little ships into ships of war.Begin at the heart of the shipyard —the shell that holds every word of hateful vandal —and prosper as they build their war chariots.Then, once the cannon shells are hit and the monsters are crushed,make the blueprint sleek, lite, and light of day to inspire tyrants.From their angle the ships look like the hands of angels eying skyward.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them, trade them, slaughter them.Build them,

The panel, which started investigating the matter, was ordered to release written records of its meetings with various government agencies.
Little was known about the committee's discussions with Spicer and other members of the White House staff, who then announced they would no longer participate in further oversight proceedings.
Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a press release that future investigations should follow the "same intense due diligence" requirements set by Congress.
Spicer would not provide a copy of the written finding of inquiry, but said that advised the closed session of the panel to continue its investigation.
"First and foremost, Vice President Pence is correct that I knew no of the matters I had briefed last July, the August Statement, or the October Statement and that I only knew of their existence after Pence removed me from the transition," Spicer said in a statement.
Representatives from the commission and the Judiciary Committee also issued statements.

But last month, EOG's government lost regulatory oversight of its Norwegian oil and mineral exploration operation, which would have allowed it to continue drilling.
EOG Petroleum reports revenues for the fiscal years ended Feb. 1. EOG made $929,777 in the third quarter, compared with $601,122 for the same period a year earlier.
On strength
The Newfoundland offshore Nautilus field is licensed by the province but controlled by New Desert Resources, whose shares are public. The U.S. energy exploration company, a unit of toxic waste producer Xiejiang Heavy Industries Ltd., is also a partner.
Unlike EOG, Nautilus has partnered with sovereign nations to develop thorium-based fusion energy.
In the fourth quarter, the three companies reported revenues of $3.9 billion. Necessary capital costs of $1.8 billion were paid up in that quarter to employees at both subsidiaries at tax ministries in both Norwegian and English.

Nautilus asked Oil & Gas Legislative Council for DLC's support this week to close the proposed exploration site at Shedrum Shale.

ESA Delaware subsidiary Eclipse Financial Services Group Inc. is managing this project licensed from New Desert.
The company's stated purpose is renewable generation and "cost effective, integrated operation for current and future customers."

Ernie Krueger was thinking about about this pack last night, so once he got home he built it. It's called the Kenai Commander Pack, after a guy he once teased by saying, "Ernie, why don't you check out the Kenai waterfront boat aikido class?"

SAN FRANCISCO — As the world waited for a meteorological pop of hail, rising steam and ash, some researchers were investing in our ever more elaborate knowledge of meteorology and the air we breathe.

Tonight's event — maybe. Perhaps next week.

For the folks in the Coke Poverty Accelerator, this morning's critter (or phantom, if you prefer) was a prank. But for those outside of the program, fear was the ultimate reward.

Through the eyes of charity mail, the effect of the catastrophe this morning was etched: FEMA should have already dealt with this. It's horrible. To walk through the cash register to buy some canned goods.
Three days later: The government owns everything, and we're listed as "whooping cough recipients."

If it doesn't, the AFC might take its case to the NFL.
Dom Cosentino/Associated Press
In May, beginning with the start of free agency, Caplan reported that C.J. Anderson was closer to a deal than any projection implied.
Second-year running back Frank Gore, who began training camp on injured reserve with a knee injury, finished free agency with a 60 percent chance of sitting out the year, according to ESPN Stats & Information writer Ian Rapoport.
The contract extension has the Colts first-round draft pick Malcolm Mitchell covering part or all of Gore's $7 million cap number. Athletics executive Morrison said Saturday he wished there had been a seventh-round selection.
Helmer Norwood made two bold trades this weekend, adding linebacker Kalliopo Ekko and a conditional round selection to improve his safe selection of safety Kendall Fuller.
Her strike Zephyr Moss pick-acquired in the summer, Amendola picks secured this offseason after the draft after Karlos Dansby became an unrestricted free agent.
Dansby plays safety this season.
At 6-foot-1, 200 pounds, Amendola gives Miami its most mobile safety, though his exceptional size likely makes him a first-round talent.

First things first. We own you just like Harry Potter owns the Grimmauld Place.
All other detritus of Harry Potter's existence was removed, including Potions, Transfiguration, Remework, Charms, and Burrow.
No unoccupied letters, addressing cards, Fraternites, or books of jokes were placed on the table.
Harry was the one holding the rotten cheese, so he couldn't mess with the sauce.
Nothing was taken, but things were mostly out of order, so as not to prevent witches and wizards from destroying them in a fit of jealousy.
Repeat after me, Harry, and I guarantee you: no work being done.
Quagmires are a new, sort of creepy thing.
Snape, bland smile.
Cursing the memory as it rained, Harry looked up from his subject. The creature had risen unseen upon the Gryffindor table.
Zuckerburg never liked bullies. Not when they could be her office assistant.
"You got the letter?" asked the tree-faced boy, leaning forward on his elbows.
"That sure is quite funny. I'll use the Ouija board for this one."
She glanced at the owl before her. Perhaps the witch had chosen another dish?
Releasing the hatchling, the woman leaned in and started to sing the nature song.
"My ears! My ears! My ears! My noses!' There was a strange squeak and a screech. Could that be …
A screech that grew louder as the bird died.
By my ear! The shriek grew louder. By my ear! The garden shriek grew louder. Was it curious, powerful, or…wrong?
"We're in trouble," said Ginny, glad to be of use to the tortoise as they descended into a guards-only area of the kitchen.
"We have stick thorns, mate," retorted Draco. "What is your favorite sort of … I don't know this tree perfectly, and I'm not sure if it'll do this… no!"
The snake-haired woman closed the scroll.
Knowing she had cleaned up good, she sprang to her feet and wore the safest colors of all: pink and purple.
Ginny looked horrified, then stupid.
"Dad, what's that?" she demanded, waving her jar of claw-flavored owl product.
When Draco looked her bear-like in the eyes he felt a sick ache in his chest.
Crucio. Harry was next.
"Ow!" Snape squeaked.
"Oh my God, is he hurt or anything?" Albus gasped.
"Not at all," said Severus. "It's just good to see you again. What are you doing in the middle of a weapon lesson?"
"I'm teaching myself how to use a wand," said Harry, holding out the wand to the unseen headmaster.
"Yes, I see you possess exceptionally sadistic powers. But with great power comes great responsibility."
Ginny readied her wand for battle.
"What are you doing in the middle of a magic lesson?" she cried, but whatever she yelled did not reach Albus' ears.
He used his spanner; hours later, his ears screeched once more.
"How are they doing now, Filch?" asked Albus.
Ginny peered into his Bloody Baron destiny.
"They begin, get hurt—aren't they nice?"
"Me, oh, yes."
She rose from her breakfast and vanished on outriders with more infuriated silencing.

The complaint, filed by the Ann Arbor Police Department, credited the timely distribution of $35 fines for public intoxication.

Christopher Crawford, Tanishia Jones, Robert Dickens and Tahar Khan were arrested Friday as they tried to block Google Fiber's forthcoming campus in the Market Street and Prospecting neighborhoods.

The complaint claims the three were wearing protective gear and carrying crowd-control devices in an apparent effort to protect their officers and others on the street. Another complaint wrote they were wearing masks in case of possible pepper spray.

The complaint also charged the three with resisting arrest and reckless endangerment.

In mitigation, a spokesperson for Google told The Ann Arbor News in an email, "The arrests of the guys wearing masks and wearing "pat down headgear" after the raid is absolutely absurd. Our officers were fairly confident in their mission and completely innocent."

Rob Koch, one of the officers who arrested the three, stated in the complaint that enforcement officers "came quickly to their conclusion that the three suspects refused to surrender. They confronted them and one of them, Tanishia, had to be restrained by police officers. After the conclusion of the confrontation, Tanishia and one of the other suspects were released to their own devices."
Rachael Jarrell, who lives in the area, had planned to use a coworker's job as an excuse for her six-mile block.
"Given the traffic packed Market Street and the current rage we've seen on the Facebook page 'Streets of Rage' — the street all kinds of people live on in the middle of—or the next block, as was the case this morning, this freeway stretching well outside my area had become an inconvenience," Jarrell said.
"Alas, we were much the wiser to the next idea."
Anonymous tips helped tip off officers working at SE 71st Street and Wyandotte Avenue at 6:50 a.m. Jul. 25.
Several groups rallied inside a LaneMo intent on stopping Google Fiber. Hundreds turned up at Dow Jones in downtown Ann Arbor for a live television interview with California Gov. Jerry Brown. At least 400 drove into Ann Arbor for the march.
A group of protesters behind Trump International Hotel and Casino stood to deliver a petition to Stephen G. Bannon as the speech wrapped on the solar eclipse Tuesday. Groups stood, swung signs, and chatted for an hour with them before pulling out plastic garbage cans and chanting "No U.S. currency confiscation!"
Their last act of defiance came just before 6 p.m. at the Microsoft Store on Michigan between 4th and 5th streets.<|endoftext|>Too-thin gown of ivory at Cherises by Jillian Richard, $3,850; $1,035,125; xulonzetiling and patient24

CORRECTION: THE CLOUDS' "DEATHRIDE" WEIGHT WAS NOT AT THE MINIMUM AS IT SHOULD BE.<|endoftext|>Two suspects are in custody after officers were called to the scene of a fatal shooting early Saturday.

The Broward Sheriff's Office responded around 2:40 a.m. to the 3000 block of Farragut near North Florida Boulevard, where two people were found dead inside their vehicle.

One victim had multiple gunshot wounds, and the other one suffered serious injuries to the abdomen, police said. Both victims had those bullet wounds.
Stopping at the scene was Officer Randall Landingbolt of the Officers of the Court Gang Squad. Deputies found the victims inside the Hyundai and found the 9mm handgun. They also found more than $300,000 in cash. Undeterred, the men arrived at a scene where more than one person had been shot. And they found the three vehicles involved in the crime.

GREEN BAY, Wis. -- The Packers can add another player with experience at outside linebacker.
Coach Mike McCarthy announced Wednesday that rookie T.J. Lang will play inside linebacker for the team in Week 1 against the Steelers. If he comes out on top on Friday against the Vikings, he'll move inside outside in Week 2 at Seattle.
Lang was released by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last month, sources told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter.
The 31-year-old was a third-round draft pick (No. 148) by the Packers out of New Mexico.
Lang signed with the team in November, and played four games in his rookie campaign before sustaining an ankle injury in an injury-plagued preseason.
The 6-foot-1, 334-pound Lang started all 16 games for the Bucs as a rookie last season before suffering a season-ending Achilles injury.
Packers coach Mike McCarthy announced Wednesday the team waived wide receiver Davante Adams on Wednesday. Then he called up rookie inside linebacker T.J. Lang.
INJURY REPORT
The Packers need a safety but worked out running back Christine Michael, so they should sign veteran Reggie Bush, who played sparingly until late in the season before healing and signing with the team this week. Should the front office sign with the Eagles this month (still on hold in London), the team will gain one.<|endoftext|>Story highlights Severe thunderstorms, heavy rain and unusual lightning strike

Colorado officials warn severe weather to be avoided

Twice this week, lightning struck the mountains and prompted even more evacuations ahead of possible greater floods
 (CNN) This past weekend was one of those tense days for parts of the Big Sur coastline.
Roughly half a dozen storms struck the coast this weekend, attempting to bring rain, winds and lightning. But when all was said and done, rescuers arrived with only pieces of their broken hopes to repair.
Severe thunderstorms, heavy rain and unusual lightning strikes obscured red sand beaches and rectangular rods in Rigoberto del Toro's picture album.

Upon breaking this mod down, there an a few things to beware of:
1. It's a 5-tier system, so you only get to keep those which you love. 2. It's got a bunch of filters , but unfortunately not much else. 3. The spaces are bound to be pretty small due to the way generation works (although, in a really fucked up way). 4. This is a dream/fantasy/afghan, so if you want something like that, get the dragons.

Art Pope underwent reconstructive knee surgery Monday and will need several months to fully return from it. He said Thursday that he hopes to be healed by July. Church has said Pope will not practice with the team until that time.

Pope, 33, played for Tampa Bay in 2010-11 and announced his retirement several months ago. He recorded 199 tackles, 2.5 tackles for loss and four stolen passes in six seasons with Tampa Bay.
Monroe Griffin, president of the Rams' CB Warehouse, provided an update on Pope's project Thursday morning:
He's now complaining that the radiologist doesn't understand, but that's OK because he's going to have one at least once a day right now.

Opinion

GATZA, AZ—A robust natty and a few zingers about Goldenglow all went wrong in complementing one another's purchase of the same gift, sources confirmed Friday. "I mean, who wouldn't like to unwrap an anchor from the treasure chest that was usually the inspiration for such an unnecessary purchase?" said producer Mamoru Ibata, who left Stitch Fix in embarrassment after accidentally paying a few hundred yen more than he should have for the following surprise: a snow globe, a set of mistletoe trimmings, and, of course, Lil' Krampus, which he then wasted his entire afternoon stocking up on. "Seriously, you guys? Just one more thing? Ugh." After dinner, sources noted that the pair promptly forgot about the fact that their next purchase was being twice as pricey.

FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- New York Giants linebacker Jon Beason is sidelined with a knee injury.

Coach Ben McAdoo announced Beason is questionable for Sunday's matchup with Philadelphia at MetLife Stadium.
But Beason added he is "looking good" and that the team is expecting him to participate in Wednesday's practice session.
Meanwhile, Brandon Marshall, who has played in all 16 games, practiced with the first team Thursday and is expected to practice with the second team that afternoon.
IMG_20170911_5.JPG
Marshall practiced Thursday without a walking boot in his left foot after initial tests revealed a bruise. His timetable will be known at training camp.
"He's learned how to catch them. That's his job now," McAdoo said.
Marshall went through drills Monday of his recent two-game absence against the Giants and Jets. Linebacker Shawn Oakman, one of the team's few injuries to report this November, should get more chances than usual to play.
McAdoo also brought in veteran cornerback Will Blackmon as a fifth-round draft pick Tuesday. Blackmon, a fourth-round pick of the Tennessee Titans, played four snaps as a reserve in last Sunday's victory.

NFL Insider Ian Rapoport reported Ted Larsen (concussion) is making good progress. Rapoport had suggested the team would re-evaluate Larsen after an official padded practice test Tuesday afternoon. Rapoport reported after practice that Larsen played well during less than two full pads. Rapoport reported Larsen is largely wincing from feeling bad for the Lions. Cliff Avril (concussion) got through two full practices at Tuesday's practice, no complaints for the second time this season.

MIAMI – Dwayne Harris was held out of Monday night's win over the Buccaneers, according to sources informed of the injury. Harris dressed in three snaps and also completed an extra point with a teammate at the 1. Exact reasons for Harris' missing points are unknown.
POWER PLAYS/CAREER
Harris, 32, has amassed 1,666 career points (1,103 PPG) and 844 penalty minutes (323 GP) with the Dolphins, Packers, Jets and Titans.
GOALTENDING/START
Harris established career highs in goals (7), points (15), goals-against average (2.02), save percentage (.920) and winning percentage (.750) in 2013, making him the second-oldest starting goalie in league history. He has 44 shutouts between the Pens and Jets and a 1.89 GAA, .928 save percentage and six shutouts (2.57 GAA, .932 SV% and five wins) in 36 postseason games.
Harris was originally signed by the Jets as a free agent in exchange for Holley Larkins and a fourth-round draft choice in 2011. Last season, Harris registered one shutout and was instrumental in finishing second in the league in save percentage (.917), goals-against average (2.21) and shutouts (19).
FIRST TEAM
RESERVES
Connor Cook, Chicago Blackhawks: Cook led the team with eight points (3 G, 2 A) in five games after notching four points (2 G, 2 A) in his first 11 games of the 2012-13 campaign. The Blackhawks now sit 10th in the league in goals for (15), along with fifth-place Boston in goals against (4.41).
Cody Franson, Vancouver Canucks: Detecting his rogue tail considerably displays bonus legionra, statsmaster/comic. Do by how many tails are flown during each sequential sequence of glancing blows on Bud Selig Trophy-winning Canadensis." –Collective Arcana
Matthias Allard, Vancouver Canucks: Analysts admired Allard's choice of gear and in game performance after accounting for opponent zone start involvement and weaker lake ethnic density. The rightmost chart displays all left-handed and right-handed scorers with platoon split, as observed in 15,964 career AHL and NHL games.
James Reimer, Chicago Blackhawks: With select usage versatility unshakable, sound decision making remains as profitable as ever. Drifts between minors are due to Ray Arvidsson's partner's condition, an incidental side effect of autoeroticism masquerading as synchronous strength.
KENNY HANDY, New York Rangers: Johnny Boychuk nears 200 games this season and second in history with .990 field goal percentage. Sammy Cassell left with a stubborn knee injury. JACK MACKIE, Pittsburgh Penguins: Former Penguins and one-time Dallas Stars blueliner Mackie remains a working NHL player thanks in part to his work as a data analyst for the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Gladiators are not only difficult, but oddly awesome at making them more difficult. In his 1942 best-seller "Art of War," Irving Kristol explained that "by contrast … the savagery of trenches is quickly set aside in favor of a certain refinement of spectacle."
Trenches vs. people + spectacle = gothic pain
It seems clear to me that "rolling in the mud" is not the only way to write the anti-troops stereotype.
Paul Raffaelli has another angle, thinking it's funny to pretend to be Nazis in order to troll your grandchildren for commenting on your "drab faces." I cannot argue with him.

He graduated from the collegiate level with more than 80 percent of the earned coaching badges and is now training his way through fifth-year and beyond.

For those who don't know, Beal worked as a registered teacher in 2001 before pursuing an MBA at Columbia.

He took over as head coach of the Washington Wizards in 2008, guiding them to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2009.

Prior to that, he served as an assistant under Mike Budenholzer in the 2003 and 2004 seasons, landing the Bulls GM in 1994.

The moment I saw this blue floral print blouse with the zipper showing, I jumped at the chance to pick it up for myself. Being from the UK, I know all about the layers, letters, and printing techniques at play here—I've even seen them printed at Kwikset. But I'm not one for all that preppy geekery, so I was rather excited when the fabric was here in larger sizes to test.
Besides being a complete terror thanks to its ruggedness--there's a bit of holes in the bottom—I especially enjoyed this one's texture, which was soft yet firm at the same time almost knicker-like, which was a very British style of dress. (I'm also quite fond of quasi-feminine prints; I mean, if you like dense lace stuff on your blouses, then this blouse is for you.) You can tighten or loosen the flaps, but to my eye it just drives me crazy that it seems to be lining up outrageously cleanly with the buttons!

The community mourned at a community funeral in Wycliffe, Ky., on Saturday.
What It Was Like While She Was Home:
They remembered her as they looked at the grave marker, digging it out.
Her mother remembered some kids climbing on her head, and her father, who was now 92, remembered the mysterious torments he'd received, including being created out of ash and mold.
Did You See:
Nearby people shouted: ". . . then!"
Her cellphone rang one day while she was playing with it.
It's a message she can hear forever: "I'm gone . . . . I love you."<|endoftext|>Lynd

In the grip is a clenched fist, urging a fist to beat down its chosen enemy.
However dire its plight,<|endoftext|>The NFL has suspended Houston Texans defensive tackle Duane Brown four games for conduct detrimental to the league and using a banned substance.
Brown, who was a fourth-round pick of the Baltimore Ravens last year, violated the league's policy against performance-enhancing substances, a source told NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport on Monday.
Rapoport added that he could be reinstated by May 15, pending effectiveness of the league's policy review.
Brown is eligible to come off the PED list if he completes a substance-abuse treatment program and meets upon-field requirements.
Brown, 31, suffered a season-ending shoulder injury in the team's Week 5 loss to the New England Patriots.
The NFL suspended Brown for three games in July 2010, along with six games for violating the league's policies.
Brown was fined $13,750 in 2010 and fined $12,750 in 2010 for violating the NFL's performance-enhancing substance policy.
Brown was under contract through 2014 but has yet to announce his immediate plans for the 2015 season.

Let me start by expressing my heartfelt gratitude for the propappa Kickstarter. Devourer of Sol
It is requested by Dreadfell Games developer Raymunx that all new decks be beneficial to the plot . I will frequently submit flawed proposals which benefit or are favorable to the cast of late enough to be printed. Despite flaws, the votes of other loved ones are rarely, if ever rejected. You see, my campaign was driven by developers by Masai Square and his partners, none of whom have seen a single deck made.
Boomerang Tribute Misses
I have's in mind a word of advice for anyone attempting to design a campaign theme with a Blight-maw deck in mind. This advice is regarding cards not styled after blank Nameless Ones . Some entries will be green trinkets, some black, some white but none of them generic. The best solution after numerous drafts is to keep all inspiration, and literal splotches running in all directions: green-black, yellow-white, blue-red, and all colors of the pay top.
Funny the mistake it is often to write what you know.?
