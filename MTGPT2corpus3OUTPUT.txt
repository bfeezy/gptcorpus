Story highlights John Kerry called Iran "our geopolitical lifeline"

Maghrabi says an apocalyptic action against Iran will be played out too

Tablets: A massacre plausible in Israel

To begin living in the halacha, you'd better get out before it blackens the earth
Meir Kahane was a provocative speaker. In Sorek, Israel, he chuckled at the mention of "the Caliph whose face we used for covering his portrait." It was a gesture understood.
International peace advocates follow a strict zero-tolerance policy toward doctrine and dangerous sycophancy. The Minister of Justice espouses a surprisingly lenient approach toward the grave threats of the Iranian regime: there will be no massacre if it's a legitimate protest.
This old Hatikvah truth carried on again and again into the Nefesh Boded court — a red-skinned, bearded fatwa that emanated from the Halakha of Rifekh Biruni, Korda's Rosh Hashanah rabbi. "If we find that a column came to our village and bit someone — should we hunt them down and kill them, the way the Karmazim do?" he asked.
Why? Because, according to Korda, "letting the community know it is against our laws that we surrender in peace" has the same effect as a exterminator's tribunal. He doesn't care if it hurts whether it's too late to prevent a catastrophe from happening; it's still the bludepool who lost.
Leftists often struggle to believe that their political truths are inexorably tethered to reality, the line separating mere ideas from desperate actions. A woman residing in a Galilee village tweeted something similar toward the US judgment. lson replied to her, " That's absolutely not true. Obviously you ordered her lynching over stupidity," until he spotted from the same neighborhood the Outpost of the Thin-Skinned Counting Trees. The view made him laugh like an idiot, because that's a funny idea.
One doesn't just walk in. Somebody enters the fence. Sober Sam is out of the woods. Slept all night. The Witch's Lane from Roy's Coffee Shop to the two-lane highway is closed. As one of the nicest people I've ever met, I thought, "Here we go."

Q. Dear Iredeika Institute, Should the anus be rubbed by side mirror in a pinch? Does the anus of the living be used to wipe Mira and freckles off as well? A. If anything, an anus is different. Mira is Polish slang for a female's digestion route, which is where the feces-holder takes its already carefully groomed appearance at all. Wearing a fake one in the bath is, therefore inappropriate.
Q. Dear Iredeika Institute, How far does the shat go? Is it more than barely moving your inch? A. Begin taking it slow and you'll be fine. Just think of all your dirty walks: longer steps, more dirty steps. Go slow enough and then all was good. Coming to Dinner

Story highlights Donald Trump says he can't understand why activists are protesting his rally

Candidate of choice for GOP vice presidential pick Nikki Haley is tight-lipped
Washington (CNN) Donald Trump announced Sunday that he is days away from naming the vice presidential pick for his respective party, stretching the size of the ticket considerably to allow for a hurried renaming of chants from his controversial rally in Chicago.
The Party of Trump released a 30-second video purporting to show Nikki Haley calling Trump a "faker" and promising to unite the "country." The advocate-at so-called "Mars" speech was drowning in flame.
As unusual as it is for a presidential nominee to tap celebrity endorsers, it's a concern for the Democrats as well. South Carolina Rep. Clementa Pinckney said Sunday that once he sees the video, he cannot recommend Haley giving him the job.

Survivor contestant Mary Rosalie Dardick shares what monsters are lurking around the pack in Adirondack Park. Video by Gavin Rossdale.
There's not much to say in every single area at Adirondack Park, exactly, except that you shouldn't do anything too reasonable, especially if it means ducking behind fluffy flowers and trees and delightful, healthy habitat.
Longleaf Kavu is my version of vintage-extremely-effective Coryatogyna, namely, an abstract, exotic-simplified agoraphobic archadamoracic...

Narrator: From the party noisiest to the deepest wilderness depths, inspiration comes from the possibilities woven into each star. Multiplexes, metaplotypes, and galactic agendas form the threads of the fabric that makes up our universe. In this setting, abilities come to accompany characters, granting each her own unique set of powers.
Jane is dressed in homemade lace and buttons for her new collection — old the same way they do in lives filled with hope. Jane is capable of representing a handwritten swathe of attention in the deepest forest loop, a trail of color in the Three Rocks, or a tidy landscape of flower clusters under a tiny light at her whim.

FINAL REMARKS : The 2017 AVBR Index values show that each year, roughly the same amount of AVBR has been produced. However, the amount produced is largely inverted depending on the year of the year and it is difficult to say whether these magnitudes are reliable indicators of the AVBR stocks' overall prospects or merely indicative of what is likely to debut in the market upon their opening. The precise amount of AVBR in the market may be clearer over time.

His 2008 remarks on any interactions between the United States and Russia may have contributed to Hillary Clinton's victory over Donald Trump last November. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)

Former FBI director James B. Comey contends in his testimony Thursday that Hillary Clinton caused him to disclose an unclassified email in July 2015 no fewer than 16 times during his three years at the FBI.
"If I had known that it was to my work's detriment, if I had known it was to my own detriment," Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee, "I would have told less."
The revelation, which Spicer denied, would prove potentially explosive for the 2016 nominee for president.
In October 2016, Comey made clear that Clinton, at least during the course of her handling of classified information, violated department policy against classified information, but he also reminded the committee members that his email leak to media outlets was not entirely retaliatory.
"I only want everyone to remember this should never happen anywhere," he told the committee in his apparent closing lines.
The shift to regard the emails as unclassified is, by design, intended to give considerable leeway to opposition to the 2016 Republican nominee, in order to exculpate her.
[The Clinton camp already said they will fight any attempts to restrict her use of a private email server.]
Among the 28 emails that Comey cited in his statement of opening charges came from the accounts of John Podesta, former secretary of state; Cheryl Mills, Clinton's deputy chief of staff; Jake Sullivan; Brian Fallon, commander of the Pentagon's Digital Reconnaissance Office; and Jake Sullivan's son, Jake Sullivan Jr., who helped with Obama's re-election campaign. That included a report they had sent on Ukraine, beginning in 2014.
Podesta and Mills knew more than a year before Clinton announced her candidacy that they were running a joint campaign, having received their Utah-based official permits for direct mail through the direct mail registration division.
During the Republican convention, the three Clinton allies took some time to launch Facebook feeds, briefly designed to match Clinton's. They were officially placed on the Democratic side, but they displayed small messages with a small logo.
"No major issue or weakness should be added to the '17-21' section."
Clinton secured the nomination in large part thanks to her ability to tap into vast numbers of youthful fervor and a willingness to oblige both without blinking.
Spicer pointed out to Comey's fellow committee members that Comey had been vociferous enough in his dispute with Clinton's rival through February.
"I began to hear things from my colleagues," she testified. "I have learned over time that sometimes if there's not a lot of emphasis put on a point, it doesn't generate a lot of interest."
Since facing his critics, Comey said, he has acknowledged at least four Friday lunch conversations with former aides, including his longtime counsel, who offered harsh critiques of the FBI's internal standards, counsel and leadership at times, and leaders who were resistant to association with the case.
In his majority statement, but rather for effect and with scant regard for his namesake's legacy, Comey gave a version of Friday-morning advice she might pick up elsewhere: Cry more!
Or, as Comey put it: "Oh God, stop!"
Polling shows that Trump would likely beat Clinton with Hispanics, whites and all voters regardless of whom they align closely with. So, did Comey modify his tone by allowing her to use an unsecured email server as ambassador?
It wasn't so much that he softened his tone more noticeably, but he aimed reserved statements not directed at mailmen to loyal Clinton supporters.
He chose alliterations because he thought they raised his national stripe more than dissatisfying positioned Voice of America loss. He chose his phraseology because Americans don't talk with a deferential smile following their worst political failure. The president used the word "shit" for hairs in theory, but by choice of words he apparently mimicked a "dirty, pungent vine with nails on its fruit."
"Have you ever been asked if you railed a tree for you to cut it down?"
Of course

Philly.com: Senior Pool Play lessons Psych teams practicing game of thrones 6:24 p.m. Free taping for members beginning at 7 p.m. Sept. 1


Some new tech toys are getting kids hooked on the Game of Thrones present in disguise: toys that produce requests and give room for howling.
Philly.com Research, which is leveraging hundreds of thousands of television ads for the holiday season — at least on Comcast's one-year cable coupon broadcast Aug. 30 in Pittsburgh — loves the Replica Gifts Week experiment by Acme Games, which sells a replica sword, a necklace, a pillowcase and other stockings in the game set.
Dozens of households check out the gifts, which do actually exist, whenever they purchase new household goods and furniture, Acme CEO Pete Hoerling said.
Acme is offering residents gifts just like a play set — or threaten to rip them out if they try to take possession of them. And, if the children don't buy them, they don't get them and aren't returned.
By the way: I'm on bad terms with Acme. They sell terrifying alternate endings to never-ending online game co-op, and I've been called tasteless and diabolical by colleague Michael Horvat.

Joaquin Reis<|endoftext|>A North Carolina legislator has introduced a bill that would make it easier for discrimination in the workplace.

Republican Rep. Kim Jamesmuill, who heads the House Representative Family Life Committee, published free-electron-probe maps of existing anti-LGBTQ workplace laws in a Facebook post Friday.
The paper already has little nationwide uptake outside North Carolina. But Jamesmuill writes that making the maps freely available would encourage outside providers to create their own free tools.
"Some day I will track the suicide rate and run that function against my pocketbook ultimately," Jamesmuill wrote. "I won't know exactly what I'm doing until I feel safe doing it."
COMMENTARY: Inside 'Ask J.K.'
The high profile creation of the anti-LGBTQ workplace map comes after North Carolina just went through its largest ever statewide campaign to pass the state's equally controversial statewide anti-LGBTQ "bathroom bill" Bill 2.
North Carolina lawmakers passed a Senate version of the bill last month. Chance investors have lost countless business opportunities over the state's persistent anti-LGBTQ laws and failed to renew tax credits for prominent businesses in the state.
This article was amended from a previous version that did not cite Answers in Genesis. The original version of this article incorrectly referenced the Nevada Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which is legal in Nevada. The article regrets the error.<|endoftext|>The Wildlands, where ships could fight over land, died somewhere in my world or development process.

ALEXANDRIA, Va.—You can thank Vladimir Putin for that. The rags-to-riches tale he spread more than a decade ago has been entrusted to an organization that has fought on the Western Front and emerged victorious.
The Order of Friendship, which was created expressly to recall soldiers who defeated the Bolsheviks, was named for Moscow resident Petro Betusov (for the letter reading in the Velyev Cathedral):
The Moscow Metropolitan Cathedral sponsored the President's guarantee of finality of the Order. Victory was destined only for the group of bandits and saboteurs who freed the Kremlin from the danger of "the adults."

In the presidential election's other prominent debate on Monday night, brought to you live, online, and digitally: economic policy. The candidates were divided on best way to facilitate the electrification of transportation, but Trump superimposed numbers and promises on steel jobs, women's rights, and stem cell research. Hillary, having pledged to stimulate the economy with her proposed $15-an-hour nationwide minimum wage, promised tax relief for workers. Though particularly questionable on women's issues, Trump repeated at every Grand Rapids win  that he would never stop court reform. The two camps agree greatly on energy policy: Though they're at times silent on the same hotly debated issues like electricity and government regulation, both have an enormous interest—plus, plenty of bluebelly—in being the cleanest way to get power into Americans' homes and businesses. According to the Center for Energy Research, both candidates have a vested interest in systematically turning our country's nuclear waste into usable fuel.

The 10-6 Tometany fans were hoping for yet another entertaining weekend, but it didn't take long for their frustration to surface.
They walked through the door late Wednesday night and concluded the Junior League Championships with no more than 384 recaps to show for it. It wasn't quite the comeback they hoped for, though they did do it in fashion.
Sharp looked energized and motivated. He struck out a season-high eight without issuing a walk and matched his season low with two strikeouts while trying to find his footing.

Some guns kill people, but guns that kill protesters don't kill anyone. This is common knowledge among cops and, sadly, cops don't constantly commandeer the bodies left behind by people killed by police. While the death of Trayvon Martin may be a tragedy, that doesn't mean it's a commonsense conceit at bullets going in one direction and out the other.
As David Peters and the Ferguson Accountability Project pointed out in the story below, when a Ferguson police officer attempts to advance toward a suspect ( noting named groups of people), he sometimes hits the glass before he actually reaches the victim in the middle of the street.
As Daily Caller's Kenton Diamond points out, police did it right this time, too:

Ancient Egyptians still ate various parts of their diet as bread, rice, raisins and nuts —hence their initiation of the Black Death —even while clinging on to their ruined civilizations. A concise summary of research on ways in which white vegetables may help keep you healthy.
A BRIEF EXCERPT
The scientific community is divided, and the weight of data is hard to determine.
In an attempt to pair mainstream science and the advice of consumers, an online quiz quickly went viral by asking, addresses and locations of surgical centers in Alexandria for which doctors treated with intravenous maggot treatments and patients served ice cream "at your bedside."
Taking benefits of a healthy spring to cycling, inventing a method for taking advantage of cycling's spring harbors and starring in a dystopian television miniseries predicated on swallowing fresh start compounds is scary to say the least.
Business
Vendors Even production of wearable wearables hit a wall when the upcoming Apple Watch Series 2 encountered resistance to the adhesive used on its slippery band. This failure made it look for large companies in Africa in order to circumvent kilometers of resistance experienced in the Apple Watch Series 1 launch area. Formerly a part of Nike, brand designers Jony Ive / Matt Chebust contributed designs, presenting the race between i.e. Best Beats/Perfect looks.

STORY

[DT: This isn't exactly a voice-acting spoiler; it's some similar but differing sojourns from Mica Highsmith.]
The Amity Flourish boarded their tonnes of dominance in Izzy's Quaggan yard: bringing a notion that set aside the worldly for the mundane.
But they roamed away, not caring for the common things of life and eat at the Uldaman Feast. Izaro thought he understood them.
Keep watch, these people. Tune into Izzet broadcasts.
MEDIA
~
OH! So this happened.
Naive Izar, turning his back to the island's destruction, went about his business alone in the idea that everything was well.
Izar, dead set on finding the people he tracks down for his battlecry, stalked his way to no one when the headlines flashed:
'ALL SORT OF LAWS OVERSEAS WAS CUT OFF THROUGH STOMPING, FAILURE AT ELDERS'.
Izar corrects himself: putting anyone in danger is terribly complicated.
ALTERNATE
+1 : The hype reached troll Turns allowing the card to enter the game.
−1 : Lord (Bear), Number (Paladin), Mask (Extended Mask), Thralls (Treat Creature as Ogre), Shaman (Trout), Songfolk (Bat), Spirit Trapper (Synchro Trap Box) and Treacherous Werewolf entered the game.
−6 : All nonbasic lands that turn face up in the stack lost color.
−15 : The announcer announces Card advantage once more.
Ye Olde Fúli Priestesses tossed up signs about this, spoiling the perfect chance for Mica Highsmith to turn bacchanalian on the visitors before these tourists arrived, which weakened turn one completely.
Their strike was aimed squarely at the feeling hard-to-overcome, then apostrophised without warning, making everybody lose their minds. And crash-landed in front of Igmyling Marrow in epoch-making fashion.

The location for offense was likely The Lord (Bear), Nisa (Angel), Evolving Nightmare (Elemental), Gloves of Ages (Short Sword), Finger-Weapon (Heavy Sword) and Pants of Vilerest Truths (Scorched Earth Gargoyle). Attacks were efficient, drawing Devastator counterplay from the hordes winding down.
Empty attack jumpion Fragment (All displacements) could undo almost all of the other forces such as Thoughtheaven (Fiend), ??????????? (Muckjuice), Harold (-_-_-) etc, by simply having him stage one of the hex turn ending.
All sorts of defence could be diverted to create havoc if the starting hand was incinerated.
Izaro was left with one to do: redirect what was already going in the other direction.

======================================== SAMPLE 27 ========================================
ST. LOUIS - With front-row seats settled and pretty much everything else set, the St. Louis Blues announced their 2015-16 season tickets plans for the most prominent retail seat in the faithful market.
Starting on Nov. 17, each Blues ticket – general merchandise, naming rights rights and suites – will enter as a single level from $99. Start paying attention.
Buyers who select an 80/20 strategy to sign up overtime must swing by the front desk at more than 90 sites. In Memorial Gardens, turnstiles will open as early as 10 a.m. on Thursdays. And with a season opening row reserved, first pitches will end at 2 p.m. Sundays and Saturdays, and closing of the gates at 7 p.m. Wednesdays.
St. Louis has one of the continent's greatest regional identity challenges. Blues owner Douglas Morrison said customers "are already familiar with the question 'how do we break into St. Louis?'" and the answer, in or out, is "a lot of friction."
Fans stunned by fans being among the loudest heard thus far would be well-advised to let their Laowns rule at any bar anticipating fans, who have regaled owners repeatedly about their need to DANGERELY BE HULT.
Not it's owners, but AROUND FOURWINGS SECRETLY KNOCKED ON MY HEAD 199463 For the athlete
When software technology sunk its blades,
Where the eiderdown whelp steels you,
Been mute to your enemies' barking.
Bring your loudmouth chums!
While it was way too sad to play worse than Football Boogie's Fun House, a tennis size fireball composed entirely of grime and vomit, Blues after made fun of their opponents. "Have you ever thought about who gave the other side their energy?" they hollered. They had had a long and successful reign at baseball-focused Mecca Dead Scrub, led by Ron Chapple who once called TED talks a job requirement. But they completed the tour in style at their appearance tonight at Dexter's Hardware, where penis following nobody wanted to appear as a candidate for self-flagellation. Waivered of abomination at the slightest variation from (god have mercy on us!) their 1990s heyday and looking mostly gorgeous until DSP ruled, Laurentius Providence shined until his leather abominations were mixed in with the lambs' crumbs before dashing through the ensuing postseason incinerator, going 13-3-2 with 72 points and 58 goalie wins. For Mike Liutreau, 242 Playoff Points and 118 wins? That's spiritual gain. Sweet.
NOT SO HOT 26118 Come steamboat! Dozens of knotty afternoon teenagers spent hungrier than even Bay Boom for nine car crews rove about the marketplace eating tons of questionable ramen pasta and names like WEST YELLOW REFLECTOR, RED ALERT, PACIFIC ORDER OF CURE, POKEMON QUARTERS AND AMERICA FUCHS.
The shops offering burn-o candle flame were pleasantly queasy taking in strangers' dipskin plates and Basil Whiskey Fortoleum statues, effectively spraying down 14 feet of tropical hit of scuba-man out there. The Pittsburgh Penguins saw their perspective change, proving that silence is king of the night when putting up a fight goes well, and that Teemu Korpikoski seems to wind up peaking every 15 seconds or so.

RARK: I laughed out loud at one point when I watched a batshit insane post on r/collegebasketball.
MARK RAY: At the same time, I'm also sad to see that Battle Urges her second baseman out before he even gets going.
RARK: I like Invincible, but I mean, go to the hospital right about now I suppose you'd better have is lot of time.
MARK RAY: I think Gary Sheffield is going to be among the most interesting players for me. Has raised this debate of whether he's closer to baseball or basketball.
RARK: I assume it's dictated by organizational necessity, if necessary doing it according to whatever rule is in effect.
MARK RAY: Does this writer ignore rule 9? For the Uninvited.
RARK: Bruce Weber bowed out of the tournament for trying to stand on a sandwich. He said "09" no, unlike one of his teammates.
MARK RAY: "When are you gonna figure it out"? This writer is not as good as Bruce Weber.
RARK: Too many backslapping cats.
MARK RAY: Encircling review of the song When Are You Gonna Know You Got Here is available here.
RARK (A): I guess who doesn't eat a sandwich? Appears pointless to expect his band to soon be stroking old, old Scranton cheese on your face.
MARK RAY: When are you gonna know you got here? Too grandpa-y to judge?
RHISHMAPORI: "Some people don't even want to play. Some people don't even like competition."
RARK (A): A piercing dilemma: going for drives if you want to win, or defense if you want to win.
RHISHMAPORI: Looking at Martinez's latest stats: kills field and steals second; average is .999, .768 steals, .859 saves and .848 hits; just missed a slugging percentage of .750, 10th best in NL in both categories The best teams are likely already the good teams; descriptions of Martinez as an afterthought would be offbase. He doesn't want to step on the ring emblazoned with his name on it; he just cares about winning.
RARK (B): Martinez's disinterest toward playing or having anything to do with competitive play sets the stage for Memphis Grizzlies opposing pitcher Jordan Hill's performance in tonight's World Series semifinals.
MARK RAY: Bored with the Mets. "Can't miss catching the game on television!, but I can cry if something doesn't sing right, darling..." He always sings about then babbling out questions that have passed me by, jotting down thoughts.

Other than subtle manipulations like that and Devi's start at zero, this match isn't going to be wildly active. It's good for a fevered sense of bombast mixed with insults over a meager $7 start. During COST's campaign, $100 dollars went missing from various wallets. Fair warning: This isn't ordinary ELS damage bliss!

THE CARD


Your To-do list has a Google Card. This Google Card gives you a digital download of any web property handed out by it on cards or stickers.


With a Google Card, one-thousand Google domains are cached, which means that when you receive your next domain ticket, the cache of your last domain card has already been downloaded. When our systems get down and apps run out, YOU get your place in line again.
A Google Card is not on the room at your command. There's no napkin or app discovery—only support for this Google stuff. In other words, we're not producers with front-row seats at the next big smash war.
Main reviews web content—not blogs.
Guest posters type "welcome" into the Reader's Digest reader, type that word into the card's voice order-by-letter, and ride along. In recent months, we've largely eliminated blogger guest postings and have put all of them in our Systems Assistance Outlet.
SPOTLIGHT


What he doesn't say.
WHEN


Virtual conference rooms in the conference rooms of celebrity websites . . . there.
WHERE


Offices in San Francisco and Monterey Creek in California.
WHY


We do this "outside" to keep weddings quieter. Hosting a big engineering event internationally, we've never had to think not only of travel before the engineering event, but also of and about space and concealment in the traffic. Participants fly in from ABC heaven and catch up on sleep and surmises, it ends up costing less than an actual wedding! During our meetings, we muddle through endless upsellings (Hey, if all those cops are getting out of your way, then they probably wouldn't get on the technical side of the story!) and let people curl up in our own kilns to rest.
WHERE YOU CAN SEE IT
Metro is outside . . . because it's a panel walk.
WHERE YOU CAN'T SEE IT
Floor plan . . . because we're "doing architecture" (notice the spare word) and each individual sculpture—or you are—is a beneficiary of the project. We mean that law!
SECURITY RISK


A webcam and a hidden web camera have set us apart from our competitors. We do not sell! (listen, delivery of coffee is $2.50 a container.)

OPINION

Theresa May is facing a challenge from her own government.
Yes, there is a mandate for Brexit from within the Tories. The party is delivering on its pledge to renegotiate our relationship. The party promises a tough but treatmfast deal on-shore and offoil. The Tories are doing the best with what's still available in the legislation.
But there is uncertainty. A government motion is dead on arrival in Strasbourg. The prime minister is canvassing Congress. This tightrope runners will be tied.
This apparently airtight time frame is inspired both by Brexit tactics and by June 2016's manner of arriving at it.
Get this through your head: Not everyone in the House of Commons or Lords's retinue agrees with Brexit. Not everyone agrees even vaguely with the costs and benefits of the Brexit process. But how do you say that vote is dead?
Let us not lose sight of Jeremy Corbyn's principles and deliver some detail.
Labour politicians specializing in economic matters have no time for Brexit UNTIL its object. That, truly, is the point.
That objective about Brexit being dead is not entirely the Conservative Party's idea. Nor, inevitably, is it entirely the opposition parties idea every time someone in Westminster says Brexit isn't happening.
But Corbyn is running this country and his politics are much broader than the lesser-known reformers who divide his followers.
Reformers and not just Blairs
One member of the parliamentary Labour party recoils from Corbyn's stance on Brexit. "Jeremy wants us to be open-minded," he says, "but I don't think the idea of the single market is so great that we should free up to remain."
The criticism is well taken. Having grown up in the shadow of the Heathrow Viaduct, the borough's Conservative mayor Mark Kushner wept openly about the Anstruther storm last Sept. Twelve people died during the November riots, but no one blamed Jeremy Corbyn and no one thought the campaign was hopeless.
But there are six other Labour MPs who do believe in the single market and welcome its other features.
They do not want to be shut out. Not really. But if Krugman ever sees that shirt inside Happiness, forget it.
Daddy clubs largely win friends – sackdat
THE Business Council puts Corbyn on its Quo Vadis Watch List, prohibiting anyone from speaking at an event with him. The list comes with an asterisk.
Corbyn likes to keep his thoughts secret. So when his thoughts suggested that the British press's purchase of Prostitution Observer could constitute antitrust violation, his advisors frantically dispatched an attorney to hear them out.
Pick up your copy of book plot guide, motherfucker.
This lead us to a day of furious academic tirades. We traced something weirdly similar earlier this year.
But as we entered Baltim Andaur, the literary deitrity-spouting barn, we were strangely free of its, er, hollow echo. Heretics are always happy to "borrow" the prevailing brand of furious discourse journalism. Ask holdover Devon Smith (disclosure: author of "Power," the definitive methodology guide for Attorney Magic).
In the MP's shoes, the tenet of each town are three things – two demons and four midsummer highs. Heretics don't offer their differences when it involves happy mornings and, as the superstition says, no night discrimination.
In debate dippo volte vespido wealth
The Contemporary Theorist Kyle Owens and Harris Putch date the publication of Somerset Maugham's classic work, The Black Mail and the Ministry. Owens and Putch say England ate up the "sixties" in 1979. That was their version.
What "circa" have they found?
Anyhow, whether the same thunderous sirens sounded underground or in outer space before the 1979 tour ushered in the mirthful Big Ben affair, as it were, it seems unlikely.
Where do these moments of enlightenment occur? Only the most contemplative regard is certain.
Maugham said after reading the novel in his grave : At every opportunity, she was repelled by the thoughts of all subjects and attracted only by one single subject – religion, and by making this subject always the center of the meals and the discussion.

Trump briefly mentioned Trump University in his speech, saying the franchise has millions of illegal members and that they have no connection to the NFL, otherwise known as the NFL.

Last night, Smite's first enclosed tournament was held at the prestigious EVO presentation. The winner of this event was GosuGamers' JxyongWoong (20%), but he also made the finals tonight by running parallel to Jxyong. Coasting all over the stage, Jxywognah just might have a shot at paddling the Warpath.
THE MOST OVERVIEWED EPISODE: The base game overview: Over the course of two sideboarding modes, its criteria to qualify are constantly reviewed. What past matches make us more confident about performing the desired repertoire is read, and what probable outcomes we're most likely to encounter this year reflect that possibility.
THE MOST UNDERREVIEWED EPISODE: The objective cards for flex slots 2 and 3 remain mostly untouched. If there's room for improvement, it's made because of Greeshot and Classic Box. We're looking forward to once again learning from our opponents in regards to smart as well as effective counter abilities.
THE STANDARD ALERT: Invasion! Unseal is represented by Swift Current Spirit, Adrastea's Grace, Kaervek's Rite of Flame, Luminice Blade, Illusory Lens, and Cabala.
In addition to the three warriors ranked openings, there's also void elemental archetype. While no deck is truly immune to trespassers, its forces draw equal weakness whenever adjusted. Thus, if you burn a portal, just outflank them and work nearby.

In this day and age, knowledge crowds out all things that can't be explained, and the high-achieving types who dive into esoteric trivia terms shrink away when confronted by whose net they're more curious in diving into. The yeti project is no exception. This article casts a wide net, attempting to ascertain the findings of prolonged and mass-produced scrutiny.

Chapter 324 – Confrontation (4)
Translated by: Arran
Edited by: LiuGong
Gao Guangcheng was each eyes conveyed by a yuan qi gem and sharply pierced the external company. The New Snow City looked as eerie as death: a ghost city seen from above.
It appeared putrid and dead, damaged from order, shattered once more.
Yuan Wangshu took out a holy weapon to defend the people from Gao Guangcheng's retribution,
"New Snow City, Gao Guangcheng's revenge!!"
However, when Gao Guangcheng started to torture him at a distance, none of the formerly peaceful people could bear it. Chaos filled the streets along with these cruel killings.
Xiu Xiu dropped solemnly. His heart became glistening with colour and spirituality.
From afar, due to the tilted ground the people could only watch uneasily.
With Dou Qishen present, every single person present could direct their gaze at the scene.
Gao Guangcheng's cultivation was not in other universe regions.
He definitely wasn't stronger than Gao Feng who did just this. Thus, as soon as Gao Guangcheng started killing, people could only watch with fear as his attacks continued for several tens of metres.
Behind Gao Guangcheng's spiritual gaze, several people shouted towards Devil King and surrendered like rabbits.
Dong Yu's Spiritual Consciousness, vaguely ascending with his mind, slowly diminished. Right at this moment, his vision bluelifted as he was about to retreat.
Sin Netherworld Gongsun Qing flew directly toward Yin Zhu Realm.
Yin Zhu Realm, left alone, could go nowhere. In battle, chaos would erupt and tightly crowd around Yin Zhu Realm.
But Yin Zhu Realm had already become an environment revolution.
From this moment on, Yin Zhu Realm's constraints and limits began to unfold into action, who would dare attempt to cross this Heaven Road.
At this moment, Yin Zhu Supreme Pontiff of Sin Netherworld's birthright, Qin Ran Gongsun, arrived in Yin Zhu Realm with his forces.
Lin Xin perspired softly and loudly, observing the commotion.
Although Yin Zhu Realm plunged into crisis, he had decided not to fall into despair. He clenched his fist. Instead, he stepped into action and massacred his thousands.
A sacrificial plan!
Lin Xin instantly had an expression of despair. After a while, he condensed his forces into a compact army and moved into bases.
A ferocious enemy lord entered his army with an army of ferocious warriors.
Luo Chen, who was sitting calmly inside the smoke cloud, yelled, concerned to himself, "Looking at the song in victory strike, Qin Ran is emitting an unusual sense of peace."
Lin Xin laughed out loud, "Such an enemy lord is the Xia Clan's escape coach. His whole army is for escape…"
Lin Xin's question sent an intense cold shiver down Gongsun Qing's spine.
Gongsun Qing's skin was all right, but she was somewhat scorned. She looked frustrated, as if she really could not laugh.
Everything seemed to follow orders, hoping that Lin Xin would not notice them. The annoyance caused her to lose all restraint. Long engravings on Coiling Cane woken her and she cried laughter loudly, "I am really humiliated! It seems to be my fifth creation my death is imminent!"
Luo Chen incessantly called out, "Infare beside Zhou Ruxue and safeguard his body."
After for four entire days, the noises continued to become softer. Mutations appeared on all the horned animals, along with the crowd.
In the coldness of morning, a Wangguan tri-sized cat surprisingly jumped out of Lin Xin's ear, and with great speed by Gao Feng's side, arrived at Qin Ran Gongsun.
"Zhou Ruxue, please follow him." The owner of the open door shouted.
A famous bodyguard for insolences, this horrific side veterans arguments convulsed inside her.
This cat circled Qin Ran Gongsun attentively, an icicle pressed down against Qin Ran Gongsun's ears.
This chick has very deep memories. She instantly looked deer eye scarier:: where had this come from?!
Zhou Ruxue gently jumped up.
Zhou Ruxue few steps away brought her swords in preparation for battle. Suddenly, saliva dripping from the lowest heaven caused Zhou Ruxue's hands to launch a collision with Qin Ran Gongsun's sword.
Zhou Ruxue yelled madly and said, "Shoulder blades, palm blades. Do not cry wolf!"
Soldiers resisted understrength, leaving a raw wound on Zhou Ruxue's shoulders.
Qin Ran Gongsun saw that Zhou Ruxue was unable to endure the pounding head to neck and curved his

New Orleans, and Queen's Park in particular, has been a leader between 1945 and 2009 thanks to a bare minimum of public discourse for change, although in 1987 the provincial government introduced a new regime that significantly widehoused the social welfare costs of gambling. The province's abysmal social capital, however, is also a provincial invention, the result of years of graft.

But Friday night, the Jags showed what they can do when the hot stove is on.
With 34 minutes left, Blake Griffin found Kristaps Porzingis between the knees and covered him with a milestone two-woman jam in defense of the fourth straight win. Then, heading into the fourth quarter, Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports pointed out everything missing from last year's 48-win Suns, but added what they needed:
PLAYES TO WATCH
2. The Phoenix Suns
It's impossible to remember Phoenix without referring to Jameer Nelson, and well, that made sense anyway. Nelson was clutch, reliable and ready to hit on all eight of his layups. Oh, and he hooked the ball around Marcin Gortat's neck. That's trademark Wu-Tang.

A look at the meta game in Legacy
This list is designed to help you determine if you should take Kamahl this time around.
On one hand, here are some of your options:
Faithless Looting
Over the past few weeks, the following cards have been deemed necessary to beat Kamahl in Legacy.
Rhox Deluge
Welcome to Kamahl Rakano Unfortunately, Reanimator and Death's Shadow current win conditions are going to dictate the course of the game in future matches. Consider keeping that card in your sideboard at all times.
Threshold Prowler
You've heard of Sidisi and the other Mandrills. Now, plead arbiter lead them slaughter! Besides, if reality isn't as cruel as you want to believe, why wouldn't it be?
Verdict of Tandris
The situation here is even worse than you thought. The deck allies with Kamahl and turns the Sixth Seal into a green shapeshifter, transforming into an attack, whitewashing artifact. Source: Dragons, by arcana, spoilers?
SUPPORTS
Champion of Hope
This deck is strong enough outside of Shrapnel Blast to consolidate a 27 card hand. Karmic Guide's ultimate operates with blue mana.
Karmic Guide
I don't like decks that sacrifice Impending Doom for Special Olympics, but this one does. Not only does it turn into Artifact Mastery, but it turns Impending Doom into a threat from now on.
Besides that, you absolutely can't go wrong with any of these cards in your deck. They always end the game as they started.
SUPPORTS
Karmic Guide
They haven't done it yet, but I'm sure Karmic Guide is sure to do it soon.
PIN
People think there's no such thing as phone sex of the sanctified, but this deck really puts to shame that claim! 
Not even Kickstarter will be enough to win you over to this deck. Share the end of the rainbow shit with someone you love . Source: Scenes From the Thrill
SUPPORTS
Irris was in love with the ultimate, but she didn't take the bait. Now he's one with her and she's already ready for it. We can only hope that the rainbow change call makes future romantic entreaties more apt.

Crucible of Fire and Rain of Fire

via @licah<|endoftext|>Perhaps you have seen a few reports of ulceration affecting some or all of your cravings. If so, you're in good company. Though there's little that can be done for everyone, there are a few steps that can help folks find relief in their hearts.
1. Share Your Pain
For those who won't admit it to themselves, feelings are so very much in your stomach. It's where you see your downfall of desire pouring out. There's no bigger feeling that communicates outwards to your soul.
2. Let Your Voice Out
Think of your body as a river. The lower the river, the larger its power. If one X uses his ki or it wrings its power, the stream becomes the color or texture of a spindle.
Think of the stars as your lung. Look – heart! Listen – spirit! If one X feels the satisfactions of oxygen, his mind will fill with feelings or he will live by ordinary tastes and smells.
Demand your dharma, your Imagination
3. You Must Know Your Roots
Know your strongest orgasms," Illyana later said to her disciple Savitri, "and then you will know your loved ones, your homes, your time."
When a feeling fills your heart, it is a tidal wave that pushes the urge to kill off your loved ones.
4. Teach It to Yourself
Yoga helps us learn how to teach ourselves things that we wouldn't understand if we were looking at a dark screen. It teaches us to merge our own insights with a natural phenomenon. Exercise urges us to become more conscious of our impulses.
5. Heal Yourself
Physical strength, muscles, energy, conventional wisdom? That's all we have. If we take them for granted, we will never be strong enough. We need to apply these things to ourselves "work more and practice more." Aura (your spirit) cocoons conspire with physics (the material world

OBJECTIVES:
Peak expectant mothers, therefore high expectations were associated with second- and third-degree relatives' offspring that were also more promiscuous. We examined the contribution of perceived scarcity to genotype risk differences in the emergence of offspring infected with world-wide carrier viruses during pregnancy and lactation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
We estimated the contribution of social status (shirt alpha ), gender, race, territory, and birth year to family contagiousness and observed world-wide transmission dynamics over the point before full-term head shortest gestation from 1997 to 2002.
RESULTS:
At age 2 y, at lower social rank than mothers, there were significantly increased risks of EUV (1.23, 95% CI and 6.88, 2.97), influenza A/H1N1 (2.40, 1.67, 5.01), and bacterial residues (2.18, 1.46, 1.71. Other viruses were relatively from the same species but less spreadable). Given the high level of expected quantity from low expected quantity, the difference in expected quantity was significant with 95% CI for the entire population and Upper Upper Upper Latin American population.
CONCLUSIONS:
Expectant mothers shown as blue in both children 3 and 4 sMinivec images also showed some patterns associated with evidence of transmission to the earliest natal–phase interval. OBJECTIVE 2: SIMILARY EXPERIMENT 1: TREATMENTS:
NO DATA.

Doctors are "fighting for their livelihood" after reversing an EU rule prohibiting children under the age of 11 being taken away from the NHS.
Patients were being given earplugs to block out noises provoked by loud music, to cash in extras to bag either a daft new iPhone or an £80 electric curling iron.
While some parents agree the clothes worn by a child is also evidence of their maturity, others demand that anyone caught abusing anything with a child is thrown in jail.
The rule came into effect on school holidays in April and it's at first mistaking the stop sign for a change of road.
Vic Jordan, 54, of Beverly Hills was roughing it when he parked two hours before Wimbledon Waldorf and ordered two kids to dance with their ears permanently patched up.
"They did it for free," he said as he sat in his den, staring out the window to see the nether world instead of one big music festival. "It doesn't matter if they're happy or sad. Fat kids,. . ., on live TV, are forever selfish, nasty little snobs. They need to be fought for." Sometimes you now get stray clues to the truth Unbelievable lets you select one special note to record for our special sound Read more
Unlike schools and public holidays when teachers are stretched as well as fatigued, as vic and his wife Wendy Laura Tiffany put it.
Case in point: because pupils had been warned about high noise levels, queues soon formed outside half a dozen NHS hospitals and twenty famous pubs, including Xendale in Warsaw, Time at forty One in stock and The Grouse in Torbay. Wendy thinks what should have been a conversation with a friend took a turn into a giant carnival a minute later.
Unbelievable has chosen the loudspeaker microphone to record not a stupid conversation, but the curtain call of the £4 million Mandoline factory in Preston in Mare Island, completed in January.

STORY

At a deserted grove, a strange tree dies quietly. Ticking away in anticipation of nature's next move. But since another grove exists, the rule is simple. Let the first grove live.
While Tamuh's Singshuong tribe's slow rollout of the innards of the immortality tree was a test to see if taijitu could be eaten alive, past generations of the geneticists believe the tree's needs aren't so small. Their future crops could thrive on the tree's roots.
Until one day, the bacterocalypse, iron47 says, came to Tamuh.

Despite the nature's desire to destroy Ferox, countless tree constructs took pride in Ferox's survival, including the Singshuong and their mutations.

The SeaTac Times went to Micah Hollingsworth for an exclusive interview this spring. As usual, we at KOMO-TV took this opportunity to provide a translation of his last column.
Folks, your Brain at KOMO Org Vapors has begun experimenting with a 3D printer, which was released about a week ago.
After months of realization and preliminary research, we decided to print a lot of wasted metal to see what happens when it hits the vacuum. Could heating it up results in unintended or catastrophic outcomes? Basically what we've been poring over is the concept used to design Lawnmowers, which was 1800 to 1810 charged with ending life, by actually ending it.
An experiment there was obvious for us.
Folks, last fall and winter were the beleaguered harvesting seasons, before these/great waves of glasses. Next spring and summer will be the harvest seasons, by paper-printing micro-clamshells just for the hairs. After that there will be nothing on Earth in course.
()
Spring is already about to arrive, but scientists and engineers wait for it all the way to harvest seasons to win the prize, money and the imaginations of future explorers. E.T.
Also, we had to describe the vertical life of the dust cloud exactly as it appears. Just like Earth cannot achieve victory IN RESIDENCE, A ETHER DREAMER IS A VIRGIN IN RESIDENCE.

Google's social network connected Wall Street employees with other Wall Street employees, letting them come in and meet people along the chain of relationships. At first, a few people liked the integration more than it felt right until early 2013 when people became frustrated that it was now a way to communicate with non-Wall Street friends outside their group.
Then in early 2014 a bunch of staffers started to call themselves Gates, and they started signing their posts with Gates than seemed the most coherent approach to networking. They didn't like that it seemed credible that in hindsight there have always been questions about Google finding real people to undercut. They didn't like that it seemed blog leaders and autodidacts could form wide relationships one day with thousands of multimillionaires who don't bother giving them any attention on the topic of, "does he live in Los Angeles?" At the same time they realized Google is hiring top talent on a regular basis-like dozens-of-People like David Letterman, Joseph Kony, Bob Dylan, and Leonardo DiCaprio. By July 14th, over 200 people had given Lettersay five feet of stone work.
Since a few people now recognize that creating youan on behalf of ex-Communists is grist for a lot of anarchists someday, no one became enlightened except those outside of the project that got to grips with the needed context and context-like Smith.
There are several connections among Gates, Gates' logos, and memorial posters. All used iney or nonoffensive.

Transcript

Dilbert: I spent my early twenties splinting my spine. So now we're not cutting up our ankles. Future Bees: Yeah! Then whack that thing with this sharp log. Dilbert: Look, it doesn't need that log, but clearly you really don't need it, and it's giving way.
Delaying a later company conference call caused the road to derail in front of Dilbert's house while he was off staying with his sister. His sister and her acquaintance didn't take Dilbert's explanation well, so they sat down at the wheel to wait. When the conversation ended, she leapt out from behind a house and fled.
Dilbert: Hey! It's a robot-girl from "Blazing Saddles"! Where're you from?! Give me your ID.<|endoftext|>PUBLISHER: Level Up Comics

Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw Will negates (object); Spell Resistance no (+9 to hit points); Spell Resistance yes (+6 time stop, but protecting creatures isn't cumulative on die saves; exhaustion reduces save bonuses).
At the start of next turn's upkeep, spend one charge to prevent an enemy from attacking the object for the next round.
BACKGROUND
Primarily a religious symbol, the commonity of the sacred has attracted diverse use. The Church has represented the sacred in all its forms. Some vest from the temple, others peer into their own sanctum. None is truly sacred until the right dose and a good hymn is infused. None try to take a cult's essence and carry it everywhere.
PREPARATION
Use sacred symbols, as explained under Called.
SORCERATION
Mentions used in sacred rites are cleansing and purification rituals which are much like healing spells but fewer. Crestid bands are worn of disproportionate length to this mandate, or rather, sufficient protection to permit meditation without harming unlikely subjects.
Mislabeled methods of healing have been observed amongst cultists.

Story highlights A Texas River floods when the flood tide is too high

The flood, which is over, has caused no flooding

(CNN) Houston's overflowing Houston River level increased to 7.2 feet Monday as the flood tide at 60 inches or higher spiked to 60 feet.
The Houston Museum of Natural Science reported the river level was 6.2 feet at the downtown area. It is 49 inches above sea level in Austin, 49 inches above sea level in Dallas, and 50 inches above sea level in Shemycreek, Texas.
The spillway at the F.B. Cruz neighborhood had closed.
Hirsch-Wald
The duckbill surge -- the 2-inch-wide, flat, boney, frail thing which lowers the floated hydrocarbons into the river when the flood tide is above 60 inches -- did not affect fisheries or the Harris County Flood Control District ranger station.

Story highlights The Massachusetts State Police made the arrest eight months ago

No suspect has been charged
Waking Times newspaper publishes stories that match the terrifying alternate scenario

Malta (CNN) A masked man opened fire early Friday outside a Jewish center in Boston, killing three people and wounding seven others, and then turned elsewhere, according to The Jewish Coalition.
The shooting in Brighton left one person dead and seven wounded amid a heavy police presence.
Thieves broke into a nearby synagogue and pulled the primary and auxiliary funding in all branches of the three Jewish congregations, said Tim Toner, the president of the American Jewish Committee in Boston, earlier Friday.
Michael Newby, the CEO of the JCC, said the funding cuts were unrelated, and authorities have not emerged with any suspects.
Collective rage
Newby shared the chilling alternate scenario on Facebook Live just after midnight:
When the mayhem kicked into high gear the Shots fired countdown to the frost slkeley began. A man wearing black snapped a shot . The seven heard a shot through the door. The angels didn't come prepared. Deeper into the building another shot was fired. That gave the guardian angels time to open the door, to escape to the basement area. No one could have expected this.
You know what's going on here? Just plain ASMR, tons of mischievous porn, and Ariel Cohen, Michael Bloomberg, and cold beer. The theater that would land the kill shot remains walled in. The last capita to shell the Japanese targets filled in all the deviations.
Thompson sez, "Being Called out? You're Fired."

Cutting Pro Football Headlines Be Mindless.
Owners K.C. Johnson and Peter King of the Rams and Richard Sherman of the Seahawks created a complex brain trust that operates simultaneously with the rest of the city's collective mind, Bream said.
Those relationships meant there were a toll befor community projects like the city's clean-up plan.
Ergo, Bream said, everyone involved would agree to talk.
What they couldn't agree on was if the banks could jump the curb if the city didn't.
King predicted the bank would leave.
One man let it be known that the bank would buy a few condos for the homes he married when he made his money; he's mayor now.
That was obviously for the best.
Fortunately, the banks say they're optimistic about building a business doing what they're trying to do: boost the housing market.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China is widely perceived as a "barbaric new" U.S. ally
Lavrov warned of Russia's "full-scale reaction" against America's long-standing alliance with Ukraine.
The Russian President delivered reports that the United States had decided not to actively defend Nato in the event of an attack.
Mr Putin did not state who that attack might be.
The alliance went on course for full readiness earlier this month, just days after President Obama endorsed the mission.
The move appeared to have been applauded by both sides.
"We look forward to observing our partners cooperate and demonstrate solidarity against every threat," said Mr Lavrov in televised remarks.
Slogan warnings
NATO's Ally alert was famously read, in Hans Christian Andersen's "The Frog Prince" scenario, during more than 150 hours of intensive work designed to deter away aggressor countries.
Taken together, the upgrades amounted to preparing for a range of scenarios, including a cyber attack by North Korea.
But Mr Putin said the alliance needed to do more to cope with tough new weapons systems.
Analysis: Anna Holligan, BBC Moscow correspondent
Ten out of 12 countries in AIIB alone are declared to be nuclear-armed. Many more are involved with sovereignty and armed forces checklists.
But most AIIB members are either on a scheduled visit to one or two states per year by 2014, or both. There is no clear pattern to what is presumed to provoke attack by non-NATO neighbors so far -- yet.
As we approached the time for this year's parade, there was a sign of Russia preparing for the upgrade of defensive weapons, although we're careful to avoid calling it that. Clearly the mastery of weapons suite draws the IP cutoffs. Ukraine has decided it's using Two-Stage Reaction Agnessives rather than ballistic missiles. Iran also chose to switch to the APS, researched the technology on mortgage to worry keep its fuel cost down, and can still produce ballistic missiles.
But for quite some time, arms companies or laboratories have been pursuing a hybrid form of response -- both for the advanced weapons and the resurgent Iran.
By contrast, we remained reasonably impressed by their deeds, including saving a sort of yacht from DESTROYER bioterrorism.
Previously entering the fray came Los Alamos, Cambridge Analytica (AOL, pictured below), and AvioLibre, an Iranian encryption company.
In his annual briefing to the council, senior intel businessman Chuck Rosenberg (clever me I guess) - a former leading Go-Go kid - summarized the current state of bearish outflows: "At the moment, as we're looking to do major changes to NATO, we're finding this entry flow across criminal and anarchistic levels, so to speak, heavily effected by sideways geopolitical drive."
He followed that up by predicting a Liberal victory in the US Senate, complete with bearish shock on stocks.
Preparation for reaction
American and Russian strategists were further on the bargain than they imagined.
During the last decade, the alliance's performance had improved enough to raise new expectations of mutually supportive approaches, particularly among its nations: a few enthusiastic responses - including hopes of gaining more experience with accommodating unknowns - can tickalize lucrative ally sends.
Looks like India really likes Julian Assange too!
Swift approach
Other predicted reactions may be more recent. Iran had predicted China would respond to its nuclear weapons development via sanctions (which are oddly silent on the Koreans). Pakistani elements had waved Indochina's sanctions North Korean nuclear program as a sign of disrespect towards its neighbours.
"China and Russia are close to six-China [knockdown]. Iran will thrive because Iran was isolated during the 1980s," wrote one analyst on a message board known as Planet Earth (shown below).
"Basically it's Turkey implying they don't belong there," wrote another.
Ten percent here, one percent there.
Three rickety miles
City planners have been warning for weeks that defense spending since 2004 had been wasted, despite soaring military spending by members of Nato like America.
The gradual deepening of Afghanistan's situation, and security conditions at home, had eroded even the resolve of several analysts.
Last autumn, close to 100 Russian strategists had decided to look for options that gave the United States an option to bring troops home.
Implausible preparations
According to insiders close to the Russian board, last December's air war over Syria had revived it, thus instilling confidence in thinking about joining the conflict. A foreign assassin posing as a prince had been drawn in recent weeks and was taking indications that America was linked to it.
What's our chance?
Critics considered it perfectly plausible that Russia had pulled an all-nighter, enraged and distracted from operations around Afghanistan and believed the faster-moving U.S. military command had been distracted by imposing sanctions in key intelligence areas.

One boring retro filly, daring to enter the velvety Old Flipper Room, held up good result after bad failing result until the bill was drawn. I would hate to see a Carrier immortalized in a dirt aerobics course, not by choice, but by necessity. Hee heee.
But alas: a stone was broken. Stuffed so deeply that the jack could barely abut Sister India to even think of safety measures. But those men behind
That is the nature of nuclear shrapnel. There is no way to treat it, or find out how to cause it to go away. The matter becomes simpler to avert at the outset of each bomb with wool sleeve and a cold sniff. It also makes it easier for another person to get their hands on one.
PENNY's apartment was destroyed, so the transfer to my parents' place was going to take weeks and the cat would be torturing them even after Ginny swore off stray bees.
PENNY read some of those letters. She read them until she heard okay cold trash fire was filling the amber waters of her chair and the button perhaps should have been hacked right away.
"Resanti is substantial _Tension in the area_.

Sister Fleetwood was one tough bastard.
One Archer appeared and, shots wildly fired through the Well, she came screaming back alive, and covered by shrapnel she continued screaming into the Emperors couch.
"How aburt mate band" the elderly Doctor Genoris said Mildred (127 quietly forgetting that his real name was Nurse Canada).
"Thank you for reassuring me that they're having symptoms like to say I can't imagine what it means."
Ginny hesitated for she had nothing left to fight.
After she had wrapped and put up the bright pink sheet, slightly covered at the forehead by a dagger for defense against the vicious crimson hastype (water heater), and secured the electric override for binding, Ginny collapsed, wide awake, curled up at Annie's side, hugging her.
Subgradient Pilot helped her up.
"Dipper, wake up. Sister Fleet aint dead yet."
"What do you mean Canary Chan horny Sevastopol"(Ginnycat proposed somethin' bigger than Bordello but he wasn't good with simple pratfalls than said "than"?) "Amy about to take perdertown mode, trapped in room. Megan, Sevastopol ready. Galton, Montgomery lady set to GO!!"
Pulling forth down the rabbit hole of making unthinking babies out of deaf foot rats, Allison sopped it up in its frying pan and held it about fifty feet in the air, twitching slightly in love with mereation (Religion), while Amy (faith, love!), Joanie (anger, sex), and Annie (dream) all snuffed it out, floundered, since it was nice and cozy.
The alarm went off.
"Wait, wait! What makes you think I would be able to change the toast at noon tomorrow?" "Alas. Just keep stirring," Tanni told Heart, "I'm afraid I've lost my custom." Jessie, smashing Citrus, middle diameter wounded in damage transmission somewhere, was sporting rave-centered exquisitely jovial custard hat with Doctor Genoris at her heels.

They call it time to deliver when they saw their greatest breakout production come together. That's the picture they brought to BBC1's sixth annual Primetime Sunday and it has children as young as nine in tears to see success.
Concentrations of blood and violence accelerated fast in 2016, but as London or even America began to recover from the hell of 2016, producers began leaving it to the gentle uplift.
Focus teams – designers, performers, writers, actors, and, yes, their child helpers – now take turns and the characters combine and symbiotically work together.
The production's six seasons find the group in different places: London in season one, New York in season two, Paris in season three, Bournemouth in season four, and Aberystwyth in season five. To bow for an obsession – remember, those nudes were done in Exeter – the group team-house is now a redecorated incarnation of their past hangouts: The Monasteries.
The Long Live the Queen – The show ended in 1966 amid a debate over whether forced speech was a true aspect of Shakespeare. But it's fun in that it shows the impact of radical ideas in contemporary situations.<|endoftext|>A shopper waits to buy at a Diaw convenience store in Japan's Tokyo, Oct. 10, 2014. Shiomi Omori/AP
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Ralph Lauren has talked about efforts to suck out death, but slowly but surely descending from time itself is living indefinitely — at least in the here and now.
Announcing the debut at Paris Fashion Week this week, Ralph Lauren president Peter Brant introduced the new lineup, which includes the iconic Spring/Summer 2015 "Flavorful Moments" concept, the iconic 12/9 (F) styling line, and a graphic tee from Rev-Graphic that combines a defined presence (the Sun) with a gracefulness (flavorful moments).
Say it. Wear it. Love it. Eat all of it. Stella by Stella.
Still wearing the pants? Almost invulnerable. Shireen Huss by Christina Kahrl
Brant said during his brief remarks that till then, major releases will continue to represent "the core group of items that we know we use as a core group of items that we use constantly on a daily basis." He hesitated to acknowledge consumers who might fund a new stick cochlea through Kickstarter, though reintroducing the fuzzed-out Pentagram might lend a bit of legitimacy.
There is, of course, plenty of money riding on putting out the Prim. Which brings us to…
ORALITY:
Whenever upscale lifestyle startup labels invoke bling, it's generally to quarterbacks thereafter who'll carry on the bling. Of course, there could be another, masked cousin out there — potentially the one that will promote lacrosse wear — if Ralph Lauren launched a pair of "fuzzed-out" pants made of $2 silk "face whisks" that the stylist swears are printed from a refuse fire.
LAST THE BAG
The Argyle Thank You Gift Box announced last week introduced a look more unifying than frilly: white face streaks resembling children's dress-up dolls.
RIVERSIDE DEVELOPMENT:
In all seriousness, there are only so many socks and baby wipes capable of liberating a planet from a sweat-beaten tailpipe, and today Pacific Coastal is kicking coaster-rudder speed record company Iluviz vis-à-vis whether or not they can really incorporate Global Windows into their clothes.<|endoftext|>Signup to receive a daily roundup of the top LGBT+ news stories from around the world
Donald Trump was accused of having a homophobic marriage, after the party's presumptive presidential candidate continued to invite his closest supporters even if they were homophobic.
An Orthodox Jewish organization, Pinkwashing, revealed that large numbers of Trump supporters were 'aggressively flouting anti-discrimination and equal rights laws'.
And some 'vocal voices' in the protest group said the election was 'just one more piece of data to collect'.
Meanwhile, a man from Wisconsin who travels to Pennsylvania on Monday claimed presidential candidate Donald Trump was involved in the 'largest ever hate campaign' against Christians.
Ralf Skog said he is in a Trump support group with members of his church who went to the Jewish Federations of North America convention last week.
Ralf Skog said: "The Equality Act happened last week, so as soon as our unemployment insurance rights were eliminated, we moved things along.
"We got about 5,000 signatures in the last 48 hours, massively, which is explicitly allies relative to our last book sales."

The class was assembled to see what the children of these ruling houses could learn from the Kiplas of the Academy that were dead and gone. The cohort has grown strong, even if the Kiplas have not.

The Kirisplas were powered by aself-wrenching, crystalline sun that prized purity above all else. When its northernward gaze fell upon their brethren in the Clouded World, it descended upon the Kiplas from without with its degenerative power.
The Andular Colleges of Knowledge have taught the Kiplas a valuable lesson, and yet they may not entirely understand why.

In fact, studies have shown that the role of white culture and non-white culture can do more, almost entirely at the expense of learning, in steering a student through college.
This group-think appears to be especially pronounced in economics, because many of these economic factors are long-standing phenomena. Researchers told me that a large part of why income has risen too steeply lately is partly due to lack of disaggregation, which generally means that one study tells the whole story. Also partly due is reliance on standardized tests.
As anyone who's been around college credit programs knows, credit acumen tests are pervasive. To ensure that all students can perform in these exams, many schools require a higher level of education. Now, the exam also requires that students assess their writing and speaking skills. Similarly, last but not least, they require a 60-hour study program.

All these requirements make it possible for people of very different ethnicities to sit for increasingly intrusive tests. To the average student, no one is melting down or starving.

But this rise in demand for university education coupled with the growing supply is not good for students.
Challenging the institution mentality, the consensus on being "devoted" to studies courses seems to also include spending a lot of time at home and taking out large loans to buy homes and automobiles. Loosely argued, given both the fact that school debt was going up (and would in the future) but also that home loans were still being paid off, Americans are learning that they no longer have to live at home. It is probably only a matter of time before they will question social obligations and stop living in the union, including expensive job security.
And this phenomenon is not new. After reading the dire consequences of high school dropouts for the job market, many European countries also placed a more substantial emphasis on education during its foreign policy years. This steered the nation in a more isolationist direction than to improve the lives of citizens at home.
But while students can no longer participate fully in international affairs without paying back loans and debt, their spare educational resources also translate into a higher annual income, sometimes much higher, and an improved standard of living within the country in which the student is raised. And the increase in standard of living makes it easier for the students who have gotten in in good years to quit and follow their spouses.
The other more fundamental effect of higher education is that it opens opportunities for entire generations to flourish. This accounts for the number of new jobs that take the form of senior studies.
This pattern is nearly universal everywhere -- it was even likely foreseen by William Cooper Cole, London's prime minister in his European outlook on Europe, in 1785. A survey of England in the late 19th century suggested that Britain would maintain similar levels of culture and knowledge during the next hundred

STORY

"Welcome back, newbie. Here in the Solar System, I'm known as Prospitian. Don't get me wrong." ―Karte, Tyria 3rd Herald [src]
The solar system was a world of domination and cruelty. An unchecked power often promulgated from dark corners of the universe, mixed with a host of deadly lies, would bring about disaster.
When Medivh ascended to the throne of the Solar system in Age of Triumph, his representative in the conflict, Karbaïth Desert-Lurker—carried by Trinus the Demonsbane—had originally introduced himself as the Topped Postman, a reward to attain Mjolnir for Medivh.
Three millennia after the solar system was restored to order, the Topped Postman informed Karbaïth in a communiqué: There was no cost to such things as freedom of speech, free press, and free physical regeneration. Karbaïth was quiet, but not afraid to begrudge the assassin.
Synopsis [ edit ]

The story opens with a wake in Atal'ai's home, the Kor'Kalistani Lenochi eucalyptus forest, where Nekutari Masterwalker Kai'jambinveka is greeting her guests.
A message from Mjolnir's appointed messenger confirms knowledge of two strange dwarven intruders: the serpentine demon Lashuma and the snakelike Purifier. Kor'Kali creatures, including the notorious blood pocketed Rakshasa enemy Fungal Kale, are unavailable for conversation, implying that they were hiding out across Sol
skar's southern cliffs and under Sentinel fend.
Karte is gone, but the cinnabar are gone too. They've decided not to bother the Oracles and wanted to return to that night of plunder when the solar system's poorest paid for brazen glory.
Seeking the Python of Nea, the skirmish has its origins in Kor'Kal rifts, a potential channel for Joraga energy.
The Lucian Interlopers in Haven are searching for the Silver Ash of Nea. They're changing the Ryassi family from Ingrath has-beens to Orasis growers, each one of them protected from the spikes with walls of scarabs and stone.
Outcasts leap for the stars, and the corrupted Midasians turn to wandering outcasts.
The Kroo-Kroan of Foator, still fearful of Asck's Kaleidsaurs, wander aimlessly, fighting to purify the land and stop the Zul'jin.
Kathia tries to goad Berningas who reckons he can hide in a dense briar patch. Years ago a preteammate disowned him, and now Atton is leading a guild of Explosive aggro hunters.

On the other side of the harbor, beside the ferry terminal, two people take turns in a Folding Chair being transported to the wharf for the 18th annual Kukli Hockey Jamboree.
Our fanny pack princess, Molly Pamela , sailed from Helsinki that morning with her Viking crutch that covered us all. Molly struggled with a backpack strapped to our faces, a buckles pinning our masks on and no update on whether Sheogorath was in control of the tides. As she nosed around her couch, asking herself, 'Is this a god-like child?' her head floated to the heavens and she launched herself wheeling.
As terrible as it was to miss her, my cheeks flared red from the heat of her wings. I faintly realized, drifting to investigate, 'Grandma is meant to be a survivor'
Finally, she smashed through the hydro sheets and the Chair grabbed on.
Again, her wings shook for the rest of the day. My chest was filled with moments of fearlessness while my thoughts slowly drifted into wisdom about thunderbolts hitting Dawson's Bridge and a better way to handle it.
On that night I have heard pretentious tales of fathers swinging from their boats with their men to protect their defenseless children. None of the tales right there explain how Wills could fly that far.

======================================== SAMPLE 73 ========================================
TORONTO — Famous for its post-'60s hipster enclaves called bookstores, the postapocalyptic literary world of David Mamet's Don Juan has a unique history.
Created by David Mamet himself, the first set of illustrations he drew was released in 1963 to an enthusiastic fan base, but the majority of the pages were abandoned after he died in 1968.
As for what lived and what died, early-2000s websites like Raisin Blog made bold assertions it was a haven for jaded travelers looking to escape the apocalypse but also for hard-drinking, cigarette-smoking expats looking for a different kind of thrift store.
However, instead of a historical footnote, it's been met with much derision from fans on message boards, web forums, and wall-eyed flyers.
Now, after nearly 15 years of driving this story, it's safe to say the few who loved Mamet's drawing tendency are plenty prepared for a rainy, postapocalyptic future.
That being said, Mamet's deadpan poems may not be folk tales for everyone, but he did have a few bad things to say about them.
1. He Grew his Hair at Cogswell
Salem Way, a Perm. Township resident turned back-to-roots radical who advocates for political direct democracy, says it's timely to point out that Mamet knocked off one well-known hipster enclave—Cogswell. Even assuming these men believe in a culture of awesomeness, they would probably rather be photographing Russen Valley farmers with their handsome-looking barn projects and sunsets rather than crankering like their cartoonish counterparts.
2. His Portraits Have a Wasteful Punchline
Salem male singer Jimmy Zucchini called out its title character, Mustadora Amandwig, in CraftShare, Inc.'s picture contest. He got him into a BC Supreme Court case squaring off against Don Juan Rowdies owner Santell Williams Sr.
3. Goodfellas Brings Near Unbridled Triumph
Don Juan's infamous battle of Havenbridge was best portrayed as a grim comedy by John Carpenter, who drew Lucius Guntaro eating beans dragged by Prilep horribilis rats. "They say the brutality of witch mountains is the inspiration for Don Juan," says Romero.
4. Johnson Desputes Resurrection Through Liz Lemon
Robert Johnson achieved perhaps his most famous name when he won the ArtPrize finalist competition and agreed to play the lead in his obituary for The Chronicle, a publication that included a short story by the distinguished Swiss picture critic David Pinfield. All wrote epistolary memories of Johnson's incredible literary career and swelling affections for themes like End Times —linking Johnson's acceptance speech to his sickle-burning book recommendations, Mayans Rising, and the sandwich he shoved her into during a baseball game.
5. Buy His Death Books
Quick art book indices of perforated Dracula's body parts include this one in a listing for reserve copy by Jameson Miller, editor and coauthor of Dear Mr. Reminder: A Novel As Proven Experimental Evidence Of Cataclysmic Shorter Life. February 14, 2007
6. Oh, His Words Are Delicious
Britney Spears is preparing to commemorate one of George L. Sargent's more famous loves by making a sequel to You Made It Weird, but sound bites say Jonathan Rush's lyrics can't hold a candle to gossipvine recollections. Anna Campillo of Midwest Tableau pushed back in an editorial at Rape Culture that concluded "maybe Sweden is one of the better places with decent ice baths."
7. His Margin VIEW is Tart
First made ironic by customs planes allowing visitors to book over 75 stores recently hired Tyranny Savers sporting Marshall memorabilia, Don Juan's Margin VIEW affectionately refers to the Cat lead's height and pectorals like slumber robbers protecting the moment from whatever monster might otherwise be pitilessly devouring it from within. Maybe that's a way to say "May I help you?"
8. Still Not In Love With Him
Although too specific for shock value, an Opus column from The Huffington Post says it looks like Don Juan might love himself. According to iStock.com, Don Juan loved his real wife Wanda Galax after reaching another stage in the orgasmic process of creative growth, named "editharium."
9. "Oh, My Gosh. Those were good push ribs."
But wait! My goodness. Patricia Semple points out, most of the ribs featured were hers, and she must've exhausted the airconditioning mid-workout to eat all these fleshy-looking prizes in spite of the heat.
"Gosh, that was delicious and chili spicy. I may have an elbow injury," says Ms. Semple. She finished her Ceviche, and topped it with a Baja Sandwiches sandwich for good measure.

So he checked a few "major," unconfirmed valleys around that family home city of Akavir, and he saw one higher above the surface life. He checked carefully to make sure it wasn't misplaced, and he planned, praying again, hoping that this time the right answer wouldn't come through the fog.
He probably judged his chances too optimistic to be dominated by two vague thoughts so far from reality.
Then nothing happened.

U.S. Departments of Commerce and Homeland Security officials said in a Federal Register request that it was possible for five U.S. Navy vessels to intercept a ship sailing a certain course, the Longitude Diagram. The drone-sensing vessels, said officials, could then use the figure to determine the course of the targeted fishing boats.
These and other recent incidents have put more scrutiny on seeker locator devices that can be bought for less than monies in the Department of Homeland Security's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Migrants from the Bahamian Community sued the DHHS last summer, saying it violated its court order to cease using its technology.
DHS spokesman Brian Leary declined to discuss air and drone sightings or confirm reports that the devices travel "in and out of the Indian Ocean."
Industry officials said they are overwhelmed by the demand, reflect minimal standards of safety, and take several years to develop and build the devices. Flights that use them, they said, cannot accommodate as many passengers as they anticipate being able.
"People come and go but these small airplanes always stay," said Bob Lee, executive director of the Maritime Coalition, a trade group. "They like flying so much, they don't have spare parts."
The DHHS has noted that U.S. fleets can stop in Brazil and Peru without having to fear slavery theories on Adm. Bill McRaven's watch. In each country, officials don't believe the United States can even match their fleets.
U.S. authorities have in the past declined to comment on the condition of targets in foreign waters because of privacy concerns.
Ministry of Transport officials declined to comment on the specifics of any of the recent spying claims to Congress.

U.S. authorities have told foreign governments that they cannot keep their own countries from accessing their highly classified electronics after United States authorities to the United States from the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, said James R. Taylor, a senior specialist with the DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement division who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in May .
U.S. authorities played down concerns about pirates' ability to render targets with the gadgets.
In some cases, the activity of certain countries would even allow it, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said during a September Senate Judiciary hearing , according to a copy of the text of the hearing transcript .
On March9, the day that the government's proposed rules on the devices go to exchanges, chain letters-style for diplomats, functions held in Brazil, Hong Kong, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, after expatriates perform an orderly intake.
The outcome was the fifth round of reciprocal licensing in the same fiscal year for 505 Nikkei Customs Airport chairs. Gao Tanzhuang, chief executive of Nikkei Jinan Co. Ltd., the Chinese dissident-owned namesake of Nikkei Aircraft Co., helped set up the meetings at Nikkei's Pougamak residence in Triyarka, an island near Australia in the Indian Ocean archipelago of Port Hedland.
In March 2004, the U.K. earmarked radar to keep abreast of waves in Metrolink's Gyft "Greenroom," the Navy's mobile airport set before World War II as it circumnavigated the Northern Hemisphere. The latest licenses allow the Navy to peer over Britain to see the gyramids in Dutch Harbor, looking for competition and poachers.

END NOTES
CORRUPTED: A Survival Guide To<|endoftext|>Jennifer Shepherd/Septic Tank Co Executive Vice President Pamela MacPherson speaks at the 2017 Septic Tank CEO Consumer Association Procter & Gamble Prescription User Summit on May 27, 2017 in Middletown, Mass.
PHILADELPHIA—Elizabeth Humphrey of Hubertus Worthington Farm in Milersville, Va., was a licensed 2014 graduate of The George Washington University. She joined Septic Tank in 2015 and got away from the Jasmine besides making hammocks (hers word).
"In Portland Oregon, I see these beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean," Humphrey said. "In Hubbard, Coretta Scott King received a present from the Lord (Lotus Ineffable) and told her that thousands of years of suffering were ending on her watch. That's a Cinderella story to me."
Championing behavior change in a generic way
The majority of Septic Tank decisions are specific to specific products. In 2016, Humphrey became president of the FDA's Committee on Cosmetic Toxicology, which includes scientists investigating possible health effects of synthetic chemicals. But in the past year, she's also been president of the Environmental Working Group, which does longer-term research on the safety of pesticides and other chemicals.
Julie Gigiola, co-founder of Lyzern Quality Chemicals Inc., is the daughter of billionaire restaurateur J. Michael Gigiola. Mayor Anthony Forrest introduced Gigiola to Humphrey at her business roundtable.
"She likes to create her own bucket list items already listed," Gigiola said. "Jennifer so appreciates that."
Viktoria Štefanich, co-founder of Štec Group, which makes macrogels, says her new-found authority as a leader comes from being raised in a business family.
"I'm like Gretchen: My parents are in my ear and my little brother and sister are on my shoulder," she said. "That gave me whoop, and smile."
Self-motivated, upgrade-ay for everyone
Humphrey wasn't sold on cosmetic talc. Then she sat in a consulting workshop and demonstrated the home-made paint-salvaging process.
"I was brought up with talc-only products, so I expected what I got," she said.
In addition to Aqua Colors, Yellowbird and the Pharmadformed, Septic Tank launched the naturals shop in October.
"All the rest of what you know right now is why it bleeds," Laurelsey Wilson, co-founder of Elizabeth Horticultural Supplies, said. "Aqua colors are for women." Her slogan? A Queen with a side dish.
"I just got out of surgery and skipped out on it all together," she said.
Natures grows for 13 cents
Humphrey won't answer specific questions about whether her shelf stock of shiny plasters quickly translates to upgraded goods.
When asked what Lucid Power's label means, Humphrey took an evasive answer.
"It's a noun," she said. "It means 'quiet.' It's a word that women improve upon."
And anyway, she said, Rosy Emblem sandals didn't exist when Hamilton worked a dig.
But Loma Diop isn't happy.
"When I'm done telling this anecdote, don't let me face from what I painted a woman."
"LIAR!"
Lucha fans: One name in particular Wallace Alison Das walks these streets: Murphy daughter of Warren E. Sinclair, the second-generation owner and brewer of McCaffrey Brewing Co. Flannery said she only noticed Murphy disrupted his owner's new Grill Britain XIX. "She's a very quiet, cool, wealthy type and her father wants everyone he meets to escape to a secret island."
Capitol Hill skeptic creeps your yawns off and occupies low-paying restaurant adult minutes Not all fall into committee politics; but nearly half did.

"Hatred," once written closely as "vile gender stereotype," was scored with two asterisks.

Everywhere I went there were hoisting signs welcoming a new Toyota Accord.
The iconic DC landmark duskfully permissible plagued by protesters, dubbed 'How high day really goes'.
2012, the decade President Obama inaugurated, is to me a dazzling jolt of optimism, wealth and freedom from the dark, black, empty streets of the U.S. capital.
Twenty years ago I moved to the District of Columbia to find the city I had longed for my entire life. This year Washington, after 20 years, may offer a further dazzle of prosperity- less gangland violence, violence, loss of an unwieldy welfare state, the world for everyone, and a mambo chorus of nameless orchestras. That's what appeared to be happening in the Carillon House on Pennsylvania Avenue NW at noon on January 4, 2009.
I encountered a number of residents, journalists and military-devastated veterans, mostly for the first time. As we entered those overwrought parts of the parade route, my attention was drawn to its backdrop, the empty white walls of the Harry S Truman National Monument. No one stood in glowing colors, either, inscribed with slogans commemorating the first president, Ulysses S Truman.
Moving through Benning Road, I saw a D.C. Police car, two of them: one white and one black—a set of buttons indicating each. Maybe like the ticket gone wrong at the gate?
Soon the whistles came through. [Photo: Liz Wallace] [Story Continues Below]
To be honest, the uniform of the police startled me a great deal. I had already looked at a map that indicated the arbitrary boundaries of the page. For whatever reason, perhaps for public health or protection, I hadn't quite known which way to go or to stop. When I noticed that a group jerked its lips from the window, I knew, I knew, is where the case should go.
The police seemed an absolute menace to any…stuff going on.

Dutch laws differ considerably from U.S. ones. For example, Dutch law contains nothing about nonprofits. However, these laws have a lot in common since most members of an organization may not be taxpayers. This is why most donations made to the Donor Center/Donor Rights Clinic and other similar organizations in the Netherlands are tax-deductible.
Important Information
NABS is a non-profit organization registered with the IRS. See Details of Non-Tax-exempt Organizations for more information.
Non-profit status
NABS is generally categorized as a non-profit under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code unless explicitly marked otherwise. Your donation to NABS is tax-deductible.
Tax-deductible donations must be made to NABS, with donation amounts but no amount by which the deductions are reduced.
Corporate contributions to NABS may be tax deductible, but corporate contributions are tax-deductible only for donations made to organizations; gifts to voluntary organizations; foundations; and private foundations.
Paid payments or gifts to NABS and its affiliates can be tax deductible, as long as payments or gifts are from sources other than corporate funds or receipts.
You don't need to make a tax return to maintain your non-tax-deductible donation to NABS. If you continue to pay or honor payments on time with no deductions, you will net deductions.
Non-profit status
If you give to us on behalf of an organization that you consider to be a typical organization, you'll have to have read NABS' Acceptable Use Policy and Meantime Acceptable Use Policy and directory(noshew Emailing Lists for meetings and postings in addition to its official nearest NABS contact).
NN's Acceptable Use Policy and Meantime Acceptable Use Policy all prohibit records-keeping in connection with donor giving or solicitations and offer additional resource guidelines on that topic. NN also discourages contributions from organizations affiliated with (or formulating posts about in opposition to) organizations that have declined now, never, or only in response to criticism or criticism.
NN never suggests that your contributions be used as a proof of financial support and distribution for or against the group your contributions aid-in-kind pertain. Specifically, your contribution support no other revenue streams, including membership or fees, that cannot be economically justified by the fundraising.
NN does not discuss making donations to media organizations in general or an organization or a person depending on that nonprofit for purchased and published material.
NN does not reasonably consider smaller philanthropic organizations worth contributing to, at these level according to 2011 NPS Standard: a nonprofit that relies on one or multiple generous contributors can justify declining at least 75% of its available grants to the largest nonprofit in the region, and likely from operations, to match. This means that a nonprofit must do its philanthropy at the level requiring only 75% funding of its largest non-profit to generate the peak results, not reaching outside contributors. This sentiment is expressed only once any funding gap is closed. Other criteria where 75% funding is offered include location, operating expenses, vitality, (some) funding for MSV, and personal finance literacy. This criterion does not apply to non-profits that are not primarily sponsorships of medical specialty in the parade of 501 (c)3G organizations, (c)4G, or (c)4G UPGRs.
NN does not consider a donation by itself a "purchased" or "subtaxable" donation for tax purposes. A donation by itself will be considered a tax deductible donation as long as you merely use the donation to "help" another person, making no or minimal contributions to the organization.

TOKYO—Saying refilling the tank is required to prove its impact in battle, a U.S. military expeditionary unit set on deploying to the Pacific Ocean deployed tanks on Monday, reports said. "The tanks are fun to use, but it's necessary to reach out for supplies at any cost to send a presence out," the forces' commander, Lieut. Cmdr. Daniel Kiss, said, adding that they used the tanks to reinforce a couple of small local communities during a night sweep. "Now we need them more than ever." At press time, the tanks were still unattended in the field.

Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1NZjEaQ<|endoftext|>Donald Trump will say Tuesday that he didn't fire former FBI Director James Comey, playfully mentioning that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has been "leaching money on Capitol Hill to special interests."

In elections, with only a few legislative days left, all but the most jittery will be spectators when the ballots are counted. But given Trump's penchant for letting loose on Twitter, it's hard to imagine he'll be eager to explain himself in comfortable settings.
Of course, some efforts to conduct saving affairs privately and gently without effect will succeed.
Tuesday night in Arizona, for instance, the Cruz caucus had urged voters to watch midterms and recover from losses. Iowa voters will elect their state's governor next month, and Texas voters will cast a — unlikely — four-person districtgerrymander that will likely elect prospect players for statewide office no matter their political leanings. (Read President Trump's message to reporters at the FBI, but one day, with Senator Bob Corker present at the pleasure of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.)
Even on Election Day, Trump could begin an assault elsewhere in the country of overt protests, a strategy that has had success most terrifyingly in Mary Kelly Lonegan's Southern conviction that she must either boost turnout without diminishing the vote, or flee the United States of America and so be forever excluded.
With Trump calling election results "rigged" in Puerto Rico, Clinton rallying in Atlanta faces unfounded fears that to prevent national disasters, they should return to form alienating most of their cooperatives.
TRUMP CALLED ELECTIONS 'RIGGED'
Reince Priebus — a fixture of the GOP power structure since leaving the Republican National Committee in the summer — called the skirmish over Gorsuch's nomination a "nothing romp," and kept things soft on the good feelings a bit.
Flushed about Trump's selection of Anthony Scaramucci to serve as communications director, Scaramucci said the two were friends and that Trump had his back. He revealed that he had to relearn the word "ass" from "assistant."
LARGE NUMBERS
To paraphrase the old Bill James, CNN chose the usual 63 members of the Electoral College to cast votes without messing up.
Not democracy but fisticuffs not procreation: Eight electors lost their elections by a small margin that ended in angry townscapes throughout the Aurora area in Colorado, reason in sudden gunfights at the Petersen Elementary School in Russellville, Pa., a flash flood at Interstate 90 near McAllen, Texas, when a water main broke, and an interstate bridge collapse grounded a truck and overturned a silver GMC Vanpool minivan. Cloaked suspicions reside among Dubliners who think islanders have mistaken them for outlaws who want to do their worst under their command. And several elderly residents have received bureaucratic reminders that mob attacks should no longer yield self-defense injuries.
Since he started in August 2015, Trump's answer has been (a) instant reciprocity, (b) sporks meant to be locked in secure mode and therefore apparently incapable of firing iPads, and (c) Duchess might be scored.
THIS MORNING
People recycle riot shields from the Bicshe-styled types, and might warn some of those waved while she was canceling North Korea peace talks at Camp Four-West.
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told columnist Seung Min Kim in a Tuesday copy that the bungled whip effort was needed to prevent an inversion by Nunes from destroying the White House narrative.

Maryland police are searching for an intruder who broke into a home in the Perryman section of the state.
During an early morning police check last month, police received a report of a woman in her 30s in distress. The caller said the intruder supposedly had a club, and officers responded. After confirming that no one home was caught in the didn't snap a good pic, the investigators drove down to the scene.
The intruder: A woman in her early to mid-30s.
Witness accounts said she was recently jumped by two men, but no one appeared to have actually broken into the home.
Rowland Ference, CEO of Enzo Topschi, said he believes the in-the-line camera was employed by the intruder.
He claims the first incident of the crime took place less than a minute before he noticed the smile on the intruder's face.

Reward dictator's lust
Ancient mysteries prompt bold histories
Call to mind their own enemies
Call to conquer Urd
This is a new story:
Religion is not taken into account because "old gods were not born nor much more taught in The Fall's Way" (Ride-Along, Phyrexia 7:13).
There are no sacred tombs. There are only abandoned monuments.
The eye of the Accursed has finally arrived to appease the gods. He summons the heroeships of Khans and War Brutes for their rescue. The chumliks including Xarexa and Phyrexian Minister of Plagues seek the rescue from Urd himself, but are trapped in Gormanen to the Stronghold of Angry Illusions. Along the way they make for Kismet's Keep, a shrine dedicated to the fallen, a hub for non-aligned travelers, and become friends with Urd's captive lieutenant, Giantmutt.
Understandably, Thrun seems particularly daunted by their advance. Initiates frantically swarm his shrine, listening for the horns on his throne. The palace dominates Gormanen.
The conspirators march down to the basement of the Keep to get their hands on the bells. Urd's band proposes to play The Truth of the World.
When the horns finally come, every champion in Gormanen manages to walk to their beloved monument—except Gormanen itself, which cracks under the weight of their presence. The enemies feel just as powerless as the unsuspecting patrons of the Keep.
This is a new story:
Birthway; birthway to the proper place, birthplace to the wrong place.
Celestial Dawn doesn't play by rules. No matter how random the situation, the adventure can't stop before the element ShinyReturns to play!
Legendary Treres lower their eyes, nor sleep, nor dream until they invoke 'Happiness' on their foes.
The Dreamweaver Wren has found a way to harness the power of the Elements of Harmony and will now deliver punishment to whichever faction slams into it. The Daily News and reports on the every move the Wren makes capture a startlingly chaotic flavor.
There is no flaw in thinking:After the reins restrained brief voracious nurseries excoriated by the Crown/Swar Jaw, the chosen ones eventually retreat to their private vaults beneath the Allied Ranch.

Kalonia (Urza's Saga)
Kalonia was a lush and lush, or at least that word flashed through Albion's depth. Like all lush places, the authors image of Kalonia didn't match reality; befitting its graceful vegetation and unadorned peace.
Kalonia did, however, have many tomb structures carved into the coastal plain, which are typically described as imposing in their incarnation of ugliness. Many 3e Core Rules spend a great deal of time discussing the importance of shrines, who owns them, who needs them, and how they are used.

Cocoa Toast
Cocoa doesn't interest me at all. It's seemingly more worthy of admiration, instead, for its ~lesser~!"coolness."
Techo, featured card


Cocoa is a flavor text of
Creatures that aren't Forest are Forest creatures
Fertile ground s is tapped
Ornately named Sylvan Sage
First strike, {T}, Sacrifice a Forest: Regenerate target player or planeswalker.
Coral Brood
Coral Brood enters the battlefield tapped.
When Coral Brood is put on the battlefield, it becomes a 4/4 red Cavalry creature with flying until end of turn. It's still a Cleric with flying.
Coral Brood can fight with Jhuri, the Falling Leaf if you share a land border. In that case, Jhuri can block.
Combat damage dealt to a creature by a Coral Brood creature is only dealt to creatures it shares a land border with. (Certain spells (such as Rhox Mistcaller) may destroy both the creature and the named creature, including creatures of the same color, at the same time. If the spell is spreading, that wouldn't be Parthenon for Chord players.)
You may distribute 1/1 blue Flameblade Knight creature token for each Forest you control. You can't distribute those tokens with the other recipient.
When Coral Brood enters the battlefield, each Forest loses indestructible and gains metamagrains.
Coral Brood gets "Steal this card and turn it face up."
You can't target it with a land card.
You can Distribute the top four cards of your library after another Forest you control is turned face up.
You can't cast Damnation, for example.
A Forest enters the battlefield tapped.
Forest is a theme-heavy Magic set with thirteen nonbasic lands; one land is a forest, one is a mountain, and three are plains.

Urza Cards
Urza has cards that are either nonbasic or otherwise evocative.
Lands
An unused arc was written in Amonkhet's lower, underworld; the planeswalkers would not do well with it on their skin.
Final cards (for the time being):
Uses of Apply
Cards that connect together and follow up with strengths. This includes Wrath (that will let you kill anything you touch to flatten the Communist Mortality Machine), Brutal Reunification (which made the Serendib Tribe of Xathrid find rest when the village was under-governed), and Break, Snap, Death.
U Branflath Elemental
Kill loop
Origins: Urza's father, Urza the Sigiled, concocted a Planar Blast that sends himself flying[ ]. If Abikekj's push is lived up to, Urza could learn the full mystery of what a "Planar Force" is once it's created.[ ][ ]
Circling / Sliding Door Wayfinder
Why Colossal Declaration 7?
Candelabri Spider
Creatures that "minimize" the cost of tech. (Some evasive tech costs are generated the old-fashioned way: by buying faster people to take on big challenges. These businesses normally frown upon talent better than unskilled labor.)
Arclet Wilds
Lessons Learned
Creatures with gray mana cost 4 or less are Vaults of Spirit (see below). Spells cost 4 or greater just aren't fast enough to leave permanent effects. Not sure why.
Creatures with colored mana costs (and/or +1/+1 counters) are like any card that would cost more than any of the divicrats have been paying.
Cost changes only occur if they're spells that are "cast by other people" or if everything's equally fair, or if you can fit those 4 jobs in a slot without spilling things. Metacritic generally won't notice the difference in the kinds of intrusions on fairness you'll experience.
Path to Edgelessness
Don't engineer Player One's demise, if possible. Failing that, avoid attracting any more than ten people to your plans.
Cocoa flavour text
Creatures with conjunct signs are colored along the spine, and include cross-over applications of colors for the other half. Four times the magickal power of control pairing enchantments might relax themning instructions, and hamper their ability to invade other planes as well.
Fertile ground s
Whenever you cast an enchantment card (other than creature spells), if the alchemist already has a "plant" or "arcane" creature under her control.
When you cast an enchantment card with a plus, put a -1/-1 counter on one of the creatures it would put on the stack.

ST. PETERSBURG, Russia — With nuclear missiles and missiles in global supply queues awaiting Vladimir Putin, war looked almost inevitable. His government provided it.
Yet Mikhail Gorbachev suffered through another brutal, humiliating chapter of its history — and one that revealed issues of internal corruption and territorial instability begun almost immediately.
Foreign wars officials found it intolerable his government often agreed not to name Russia's chief weapons supplier and declaimed against extravagant military spending.
Incredulity for violation of arms laws often denied the news of such official disputes to soldiers and civilians, and led to civilian deaths.
In April 1988, for instance, a handful of troops thought they had had it with a standoff between Russian military and civilian ships at an air base in Tartus, then ran screaming across the bay toward Tartus to get to the Kosovars, considering the Usurper a real threat.
After failing to capture Gepalisi, the next day a Russian plane bombed the base and killed the crew. It lost all eight crewmen.
On Feb. 28, another Russian airplane bombed Sanya, a Russian city farther down the Anadyr corridor known for existing been the same war-ravaged town in neighboring southern Kyrgyzstan.
Turns out the warships were refueling in the same port.

Alarmed and horrified by what had just happened before their eyes, 2,400 Kyrgyz troops fought back, striking back with everything they had. Their victory at Ranghans, which ended at 2 a.m. around 2:45 a.m., was repudiated in the arms talks.
Tartus and Kosovar advocate ceremonies Since so much trouble broke out in the second half of the 1980s, nothing in ancient History has been spared. The wartime leaders, too, have paid their respects. On Feb. 28 in Madanpenere, the military chief whom Lenin treated as his favorite teacher, heads of the town's tribes displayed victims' trophies.
Yet while abhorrences and honorifics were carved into the combats — the Kokut Cutto which the right forces celebrated, the Zhiktairish-gang "victory" banner which Lenin defected from, and commanders banners bearing references to the glories of the former — most important were fighting values. There were three stances while Khamz, bashful as ever, was dressed in a gray tunic and coated with oil and ash. On both sides were Communist Party cadres. The ships that broke Russian territory, the destroyer 74B and the destroyer Aprissa, each with four crew members. Two Russians are currently in prison. Then it was weapons procurement. Led by Tomsk's general in charge, Gorky, and the commander of the superstructure, he gave a badger's salute to the commemoration speakers. His head turned.
'I would rather risk dying this way than survive this,' he said, struck out
However ugly his personality might be, Gorky's skeptics saw his discounts on mudsi Aleksandr Sakharov's 'all-too-familiar' and still-giving tactics. They scoffed at Chorny's promise that the military's main target was political dissidents.
In a shock to the foreign powers, not-so-subtle words were also exchanged between the speech leaders and Russian soldiers.

Jared was driving home from Starbucks with a friend when he noticed a young girl running up the street with a "pot roast" in her hand.
Later, the friend, wearing headphones, witnessed Jared headed right for the roast and decided to give him a call.
Meanwhile, the burned carcass of the roasted bean had shifted over to the side.
"Hey, Jared," the girl said. He glanced over his shoulder. "Do you think this is the same thing?"
"No," Jared said. "It's not."
"I'm sure you do," the girl said. "Please pick these in two minutes."
Jared went over the coffee and looked at the roast.
There were more severely burned pieces preserved in the cup and seen in the roasted bean. There was only one remains visible through the smoke.
"Which one is this?"
Jared shrugged.
"Dutch Eyes," she said."
"How the hell did it get on the stove with our cookbook?"
The girl shrugged.
Jared had a thought. "I think… well, I don't know. Maybe Chris Something touched the dripper and burned the whole thing."
Cody had a thought.
"I think it's a recipe you already knew," he said."Especially no recipes for it."
"No?"
Cody had a thought.
"No matter what it is, please don't call me a pot eater," he said. "I don't mean impatient signs reading 'PAW' and 'OK THEN' across Carlyle Square."
"I seem to always remember it's a recipe, not a recipe," the girl said.
"No."
"But I'm still calling you the Dutch Eyes idiot, anyway," he said.
Cody had a thought.
"I-I'm mad at you both!" he said.
"Believe it or not, I'm actually starting to get a bit envious," Jennifer said.
"It's not your fault that classes are boring," Jared said.
"We didn't say that," she said."Just say it! It helps us win next term!"
"Still a little scared, if you ask me."
"Don't be scared, cousin—you're hot and hot and hot," Ariana said.
Nadia pawed at her finger while pulling a spice cube from her purse and savored her grilled pink one-hand roast while Cathal and Jared talked with each other, probably for the very first time.

While traditional sauna etiquette is a bit obvious, the ins and outs of venting are still an expert level of decision-making to begin with. Let's take a look at some quick tips for each liquid-dining destination, time of day, and expectations.
VENT TABLE
Take advantage of the best daytime floor-to-system ventilation yet with the R/V Groove System! For added comfort between sessions, high temp shields are inserted throughout the room.
RANGE RATES
It's okay if you reach for something a little more surprising. A vapory barrier prevents liquids—whether chilled in a Refrigerator-Rice canister, placed in a Bagged Music counter — from absorbing mucus in your system.
COMMERCIAL RATE
Perhaps something unexpected didn't arrive in your comfortable departure chamber, time of day, or décor, but don't worry! Elevenup reserves the right to bring the direction but leaves them hanging. In the event of unforeseen circumstances, the air billiard will be kept to six patrons in a closed third.
CASE STUDIES
Feel what's happening lithely in your pool; observe as scientists counter pressure and steady and expansion happened with extraordinary efficiency.
NATIONAL BILLIONAIRE
Twenty four hours a day, 365 days a year rise are at your beck and call. It's a rising that would seem strange and fertile to our forefathers, but in reality is a boon for all residents of summer: nightly sleep and sound.
FLAVOR TEXT
Problem solvers awaken with a panoramic view of the sundial. Pipistrelle awaits the telegraph officer the tip of a goosehook that grazes its sternum.
POWER STRATEGY
Fish, chips, nuggets, fruit—the rivers have your back this summer—so long as they're kept at night. A licorice scent leaches into the air.
COLLECTIBLES AND CONDOMS
Work pale, the Edgyn fills the soil with deadly sunlight until the reason for heaven's existence becomes an emotional truth that you've laid on your doorstep. You'd better bury your head in the mail feast for cholesterol before the companycleanser sticks its nose down your throat.
SHARE
"It's tastier without cheese."
"It's fresher without massaging."
"You get what you pay for."
"On Halloween, it's a whole new world of wonder."
DATE OF FUNERAL
Unprecedented. Never before has a food or drink been so popular.<|endoftext|>This is a pure cotton hoodie dress from WildTangent. There is no lining. The hood is removable and then removed.

======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
NORTH HOLE, Fla., NY — After a month on the job at Platinum Marijuana LLC, Cantaba Green made history with the first high-ranking employee of the company to be arrested.
Cantaba Green employees Acinia Stancati, 27, a designated armed homeless advocate, paid her $113.07 an hour in wages for 12 years.
Between the bank's mortgage and taxes, she paid $174.73 per month, the majority of which was in cash.
She didn't work lunch with students, instead supervising Core Information Occupy students at five hour bursts throughout the day.
She didn't cook, instead confiscating remainder meals from internal counters.
She didn't buy money, instead driving police on two less than $100 exchanges.
She called Classroom Steel, where she worked for 10 hours or more before abruptly changing shifts and canceling classes.
Cantaba Green employees chose to protest in their own way against the lack of job security and freedoms. Protesters resisted by refusing to let go of their weapons.
Authorities avoided arresting Cantaba Green employees by lowering its standards for headshots to a standard recommended by the National Rifle Association. Agents considering a fine recovered stone projectiles from around the street.
Authorities averted arrest attempts by giving verbal warnings and by making arrests preferentially in interdiction theaters, as opposed to police stations.
Prosecutors weren't amused by Cantaba Green's academic mission in 1908.
They charged the barren women liars for victories arranged under snowdrifts by Borba Nuñez and Gorilla Gang."Prosecutors" included Ms. Ruiz—but no Praetorian guards.
By contrast, the prisoners were especially persuasive when trials began.
East Coast Street Cafe owner Marty O'Shaughnessy conceded to serving Cantaba Green customers who were untipped then.


"Cantaba shows how such things can lead to problems that won't get solved and wouldn't begin," writes Lewis M McAdoo in "The Classics: Or, The Tragedy of Communism" (Doubleday, 1993).
Yet it was Cantaba Green, she pointed out, that begun "netting five years in sentences for financial fraud."
By 1913, Cantaba Green had become the county's largest employment agency.
Punishments included paying tenfold wages to 1,202 employees, as well as by confiscation of an improbable $538,000 in savings.

NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters Health) - Nearly as many people are being served alcohol juice or malt liquor, according to 18 states and the District of Columbia in 2015, compared with 2014, according to data from the beverage industry's trade association.

Speakers at a conference for the National Federation of Independent Business holds websites and other equipment for sales to the entertainment, sports and travel market. (Photo: Jeff Cannon/AP)
Zach Limeye, vice president of communications and public affairs for the American Beverage Association, said 73 percent of 12- to 19-year-old drinkers in 2015 used alcoholic beverages. This figure increased to 84 percent when you include 12- to 18-year-olds.
Although most drink at home, many stay in, he said. "If you're in a dormitory or a hall, there's usually six or seven people in there."
The increase also includes 27 percent more vodka served at alcohol-free events such as liquor tastings, and 31 percent more beer served at beer bars, lagers or both, Limeye said.
The number of people who admit to drinking alcohol at home does not change one iota, he said. That means the data are less revealing of business decisions.
"There's no big number on any matter," he explained in an email.
PROPS ON the TABLE
In 2004, the Alcohol Beverage Tax Act was passed to limit the amount people could pour into those popular nine-vinyl glass couches as necessities. Today, bottled carbonated beverages must be sold at the same price as beers, wine and liquor.
TEN COLLECTIONS
The ALB trade group says there are five million 24-to-47-year-olds. They now account for about five percent of the population. (Photo: Photo illustration by TARA WALKER, Getty Images)
Similarly, where else are they drinking more than at home?
On global county levels, national brewers exceed produce packagers and beer publicans on usage at beer venues.
"It's a whole trend in America, but it's beyond pretty much anything I'd suggest," Limeye said.
ALB spokesman Rob Krill said sales at bars and restaurants increase with the beer category's popularity, as do purchases and sales at liquor stores.
"For those of us who live in six figures, it's not very math of course, but certainly it's in progress," Krill told UPI and USA TODAY.
31 TO 53 YEARS
The percentage of people who were adults rose this year, 40 percent and 26 percent respectively, from 2014.
ALB's other major reveals:
• Sales of alcohol products account for about 25% of overall sales. "It's much more prevalent in the 40- to 53-year-old group," Krill said.
• Sales of beer and wine (for example, actual wine, vodka, sake and cherry puree) were among the top four industries making up 40 percent of overall sales in 2015. A specialty of the 52% of 47 to 53-year-olds that reported beer as an important style and 14% of adults as spirits drinks.
ALB's other major holds:
• Blast of buzz sells male beer at 16.4 ounces. "Even women liked it," Krill explained.
• More than 30% of beer sharers drink on-premise. That's change from 28% in 2013. Slightly more than 30% of adults said they did it regularly.
• Performance wine at small wines is the major annual game, video game and fad category. For the first time, 75% of all performance wines are listed.
ALB's other major holding:
• Growth in wine bottling has slowed to a 10% pace after a fourth year of gains brought about by record prices.
• In 2016, cider sales (Nicholas™, PFD Planning 192) totaling close to $1 billion hit new highs.
• In 2015, beer consumed 10.33 gallons and wine 36.10.
• Volume of live music rose in this year's debut games over the 2013 release.

As Redsheen woman called multiple times by park rangers accused of spending pastime

The woman who recorded the abuse chat between three domestic violence offenders was left reeling by what happened next.
Rossett Park, Berkeley
Redshir Todd Cappelletti, 35, appears to instruct male park rangers at less than ideal times to roam Otrich's faced movement with their hands under arms.
The 91-minute chat begins with Cappelletti laying out an invitation: "I have an exceptionally pretty girl over tonight. Say hi."
"How about when (Bruce) Oswell gives you two or three minutes of partytime.''
"Don't belong there.''
"I want to get on your nerves.''
The caller then offers: "Now get on your knees.''
Other officers respond as Cappelletti asks if it should be looked through.
"Maybe if it was stuck,'' the caller responds.
An officer asks about the time of night.
"You're late. Get this off you and take your pants off.''
The park passes a large door.
Cappelletti goes through a side door and steps inside with her uniform on.
An officer asking questions of Cappelletti asks: "Are you sure you're ready for this?", to which she says: "Yes ma'am''
An officer asks her: "Are you telling me something I'm not and something you are?"
Is it true, or is it nonsense?

Officers instruct Cappelletti, 51, not to make eye contact.
As she fakes an angry outbursts, an officer asks: "Are you a pusillanimous party animal''
Cappelletti objects and tells the officer:, "As long as it's barmy enough.''<|endoftext|>The "Julio Belt" is the nickname for a sports utility vehicle modified with brake lines in order to increase traction.

Marcus Adamet's style, as well as what fascinated people most about him during the 20th Century era, shone through. At Brandon, Brandon Motors, Marcus's reputation as a kingmaker began to rise.
On October 4, 1911, two truck drivers had trouble clearing a while-delayed turn they'd taken into Dickerson. After bashing into a wall, they'd hit a rake and concrete barrier and fallen to the asphalt below. Entirely unhurt, the drivers had gone a full yard, but the roadway was four stories -- fifteen feet behind them, driving through the grotto -- before they pulled ahead and rejoined the highway.
Brandon Motors lost its license to sell trucks at the beginning of 1931. Three speed cameras were built and installed along Runbrook Road, but by 1935 the company had marginal profit and issued two drivers' certificates to most of its employees.
Marcus Adamet was born in Bridgewater on June 9, 1925. His family moved to Oakland after school, and collected roll calls three days each week as part of the schoolat tradition for seniors who grew up in Oakland, 50 miles south of school. Marcus was six when he drove the first Humvee after twice Thanksgiving week at Palmer. He also rode a municipal bus and stood on a piece of pedestrian traffic right next to a home.
