Isn't that what your daddy wanted
Well chew gone your mother is of no more she is gone I hope you're happy
She will be cremated
Not that you care
Just for your information
P please do not attempt to find her she wanted nothing to do with you or your sister.
Please inform your dad that he succeeded in his destruction of your family
And her last words she said that you will never understand the pain and suffering that she went through 4 / 27 years you can never do that
She said children do not appreciate their parents these days I don't appreciate them they just treat them like garbage
Picture your mother hanging and killing herself
She also said just tell my children to forget I ever existed that's what she said
Do not attempt to see your mother she just told us to hold crosses up against you and your sister she does not want anything to do with either one of you
Try sacrificing your son to some man you don't even really know think about that your mother soccer she suffered from many years because about crap I hope you're happy
Your mother's favorite song was called wonders by Natalie merchant
Do you know that your dad raped your mother do you even understand that he got her drunk and high on crack cocaine do you realize that your dad raped your mother and you treated her the way you did that's pretty sad
The only thing she was hired to do was clean his house his dirty rotten scummy house and that man raped her
Then he threw her side like garbage that's what it says in her letter
You know everyone has their good and their bad side unfortunately your mother received the bad side of your dad you treated her like garbage
Got Mucinex guile that green slob of slime he looks like a Ninja turtle
Just remember Ninja turtles are not biblical it's a facade
Just remember Ninja turtles are not biblical it's a facade
You tell your sister she better take her vitamins she doesn't want to lose her needs at the age of 60 and you make sure that Abigail takes a B12 go better tell her those things
Have you ever heard of contempt prior to investigation we all will be held accountable for that in God's eyes
There's a song sung by Phil Collins called I Don't Care anymore that's the one your mother wants song
Your mom couldn't have been happier the day your dad drop dead that was poetic Justice you know and she said my son is probably going to die the same way because he's a hating bastard f***
Oh and by the way your last name isn't broadsky because your daddy never married your mother
You're living some kind of Ninja turtle pasad it's not even real it's fake and phony and it's full of crap
Just like your daddy
Lentz Wahlberg is your last name bronski doesn't deserve to have his name on you
And your daddy knew that he was nothing but chump change a whoremonger
Your daddy was the dirtiest man your mother ever met the only thing he gave your mother or taught your mother was how to smoke crack cocaine out of a bong that's your daddy
A white polish Niger by way of Hebrew
Oshimi a White Russian polish Niger by way of Hebrew
And your mama ain't nothing but white trash
And you you're nothing but an ugly seed from some demon from the pits of hell
It's sad because your mother says she used to love you but in the end she said you're not worth loving anymore
she wishes your follower to f*** her in the ass rather than the vagina because she would have s*** you out of her ass
You're a dirty mother f****** bastard
Why would your dad inseminate your mother and then not take responsibility and turn her life into hell what kind of a man is that he's a piece of s*** is what he is
He may not be able to say anything now why because he dropped dead why because he was a piece of s***
"
not like you even care you said oh no dad you're not dying and you left with your little friends to go smoke your pot like you really even cared about your dad so give us all a break there must be some kind of monetary value that you're hanging on to and believe me God will judge you"
The only thing your dad had anything to was monetary value and he suckered you up and of that only clinging onto some Ninja turtle he's not even biblical who looks like some kind of a flu some sick Corona flu
So why don't you go jack off in the bathroom because I'm pretty sure your wife knows that you're a piece of s***
That's weird how or I heard from a little bird parents say that all the time
Yesenia and her family know that you're a piece of s*** they all know that they all already know that like you think you could fool them good God you got to be kidding me
Jesus said let the dead care for the Dead
Why don't you go work in a cemetery
Good grave does coronavirus is epidemic really you guys have to wash your hands at any time you can this is getting out of control
Just ask your wife how she would feel if you took her children away from her just ask her
And then think about how your mother felt but obviously you don't care
You're just like your dad and his family s*** just money hormone gang s***
Who and why the hell do people eat chocolate chicken that's just weird as all get-out
You could call it virtual experience fish pedicures
Oh and one last thing you would have to have them rinse their feet before they put it in the fish pond so you would need a foot rinsing station.
And and make it next to a shoe store or even have a shoe store next door
They're doing live virtual dance parties and GMC Good morning America GMA and you can get on live dance virtual dance parties it's going to be a thing for now
Pull your DJ equipment out and get everybody dancing and get paid
Awesome 
Yeah people are going crazy about exercising via internet and dancing they're going crazy about it
Life is so much better when you learn how to live in the moment and you forget the past
That is a how I have managed to get through
I'm thinking the coronavirus travels on sidewalks and streets and I'll people's carpets and things so if I had a car I would be spraying my car mats with insecticide I think insecticide would kill the coronavirus on services or I mean on carpets
Now then if anybody loses their job due to coronavirus Brian they have to go to unemployment and file for unemployment and there's another one called disaster unemployment due to the coronavirus so there's two of them
You should go work at a pizza place that delivers pizzas if your place shuts down
we also have the bird center out here over by the desert sun bird corporation they build ventilators I think they're looking for people to
Don't do a newspaper route the ink causes cancer
Ventilators are critical it's all about ventilators get to the bird corporation they need people to put together ventilators
You don't have to join the service if you go work and build ventilators I'm sure your work will be much appreciated
Take your shoes off once you enter the house and put your house shoes on everybody needs to do that
If you start feeling sick you know chicken soup is good Sudafed and Theraflu are good things
Be sure to use chili peppers and shallot no cilantro
Only borrow money from the bank when you don't need money




My neighbor passed away and I bought this rock they have a home thing sale and I got this tomahawk Rock for five bucks I thought it was cool I haven't next to your green rock you brought me
You know Bryant there's no making up for lost time and there's so much time that has passed I wouldn't even know where to beacon I can only be again why we left off menu for little boy. The only place I can think of Barbie Ken how much time has passed
You know it's probably just a waste of time to even try
These are for my neck my wrist and my ankles when that day ever arrive
I would write you a letter but I don't know what to write
I just want to sleep until this nightmare is over
Did you know that Grandma stole your birth certificate out of my briefcase and gave it to your dad did you know that? and did you know that mother couldn't handle that guilt that's why she sent Nicole up to her father did you know that?
And you remember that day when I made that dinner was going to be working to pronounce that ad and I were going to get married and Rhonda called Ed and Ed slow get away from the dinner table just as I sat down well I never touched your neck I touch your shoulders on your shirt I never touched your skin and they took pictures of somebody putting their fingers in their hands around your neck that wasn't me Brian and I showed you lie exactly what happened
That guy hustled you into the bedroom and I don't know what happened in there I don't know what happened in there but they came and showed me pictures of your neck with hand marks around your neck and I never put my hands on your flash or your neck at all
The hand marks on your neck or large and I never put my hands on your neck
Anyways mom's dad and I'm glad she's suffered f****** b**** I hate her add steel is dead that piece of s*** he's dead I lost both of you kids on that day
Don Allen is dead and that night when he finally came home he was drunk and I had to take Nicole to the hospital she was very sick I never saw Dad on that drunk and I never seen him that drunk and unfortunately I couldn't take you with me to the hospital and I wish I did I wish I did and I'm sorry for that I'm sorry. I am so sorry please know that
Okay thanks. Just chill. You're going off the rails. 
Just reel it in 
Tone it down and breathe. It's a beautiful day outside. 
Oh I got a new great idea for you. Aunt electric vibrating shoes.
You probably have to plug them into the wall to recharge them p
you should get a big 10 barrel and fill it with sage and burn it every night to get rid of the coronavirus or burn it everywhere you go
Good morning how are you today I hope all is well you know when you go shopping wear gloves because everybody's touching everything so wear gloves be very careful. But anyways I wanted to explain to you why I had my tubes tied it's because I didn't want to keep on popping out babies being dependent on welfare like auntie Rhonda I didn't want that and we get pregnant really easy and I did not want to have another abortion I couldn't face another one but unfortunately I was Damned a social cripple of some sort because I was electrocuted and my arms my feet would go numb Nerf RL I was at problem to be hired to work so I wish I would have never tied my tubes but I'm glad I never had to have another abortion I wish I would have had more children and that's why but be careful of your decisions don't make them too young in life.
Number one thing at this time Bryan is got some gloves when you go out shopping and when you open your mail be very careful of the things you touch be sure to have gloves on
I hope you are blessed with children one day they are truly your pride and your joy nothing comes close two children
I remember that one time I punished you West when you kick Nicole on her chin and I took your foot and I hit your foot that was the only hard time I ever punished you so never punish your children unless they hurt another human being other than that you can sit and talk about it and I come stand up and bend over but never hit them too hard never ever hurt them 
Save all your corn cobs there may be a market for them real soon if we run out of toilet paper
I know when I get old you know all the old I'll probably just some old woman who walks around talking to herself and saying weird words and say Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers I'll be saying where things like that I used to babysit a woman who did that I know that's how I'm going to probably end up
She was the wife of some famous man
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers that's what he did that was his job
Brian I feel like my brain is turning into mush
Just know that I love everybody I love all of you I love everybody StayWell
love you too thanks mom
I've been cooking dad's breakfast I'm making bacon and basted eggs and I don't want to do that anymore because iPay just I think you should stay away from pork and stuff it's may not be good right now
Stay away from me and cheese gold chicken top ramen stay away from meat and cheese I think
Ignorance is bliss isn't it
Wouldn't you feel weird if you had six toes and nobody else did
People are so confined to their own self they can't fathom thinking about anybody else or their predicament it's pitiful is what it is
When was the last time you saw someone with six toes are six fingers I'd like to know that
You make it sound like an everyday occurrence will I seriously doubt that
She had two pinky toes because I know you're wondering what did her feet look like I'm pretty sure that's what you're wondering she had to pinky toes
On each foot
Please don't make the story the epicenter of your existence you're the only one I've told and I told Dad I've told nobody else so please keep it under your hat
I'm not a gossip girl okay I'm not that girl
I have known about this ever since I was 12 or 13 years old Julie I never said a word about it
I'm pretty sure that girl has gone through enough he'll in her life you don't need to add to it so nip it in the bud and say nothing not a good thing to talk about that's for damn sure
If you mention it to anybody you know Chuck Willie is a pastor I can tell you that will be repercussions you don't say anything to anybody Julie you that are not say anything to anybody
God knows who knows what has she ended up having to join us service in a freak show okay Julie so just don't say anything leave it alone
She probably even had it surgically removed so who knows I don't know so just leave it alone
Oh crap I wasn't even talking to you I was talking to Julie good God almighty
Delete everything I said at 10:54 p.m. I'll brother
Believe me I'm glad I said it to you rather than to Julie good grief I'm never going to repeat the story and don't you ever say a word Brian with a y 
Why because they welcomed me into their home I'm just like what they say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas so please respect my wishes
You know sometimes this is one damn thing for me it breaks your heart to know barracks dreams I want who have suffered 6 frames I wish it on nobody
Yet those people or pick some of the strongest people you will ever know in your entire life
You're probably laughing I can hear you from here but please respect my wishes
Hey Brian I was just thinking about you and thinking about your front yard in your backyard you might want to invest in a couple of pesticide canisters you know big ones with this phrase for your weeds one for weeds and then one for us spraying your backyard when the dogs go poop and be back there so you only two canisters for do two different kinds of pesticides if you don't have those already
When you spray in the backyard I wouldn't let the dogs out there for a day or two or something you'll have to inquire about that stuff
And you can probably hose down all those rocks that wouldn't be a bad thing to do either for you I don't know I'm just thinking
You know what Brian we don't get to see too many pictures activate view you have in desert hot springs are the San jacinto mountain or of the Cross upon your mountain you should start taking pictures of those things when clouds come in and really because it's the best site in town in the area
Those are the two best things desert hot springs has going for it is their view he's take pictures of the sky and the Stars it's just phenomenal that's why I fell in love with desert hot springs
You can send your pictures to kmir or kesq
And make sure everybody takes aspirin everyday aspirin really helps if you're sick
Good morning how are you today well I want to tell you one of my cats Katie her ears were hot her nose was dry she was having shortness of breath and she was throwing up thank God I had some amoxicillin I poured it in a little thing and mixed it with water and I gave her a little syringe of it and she's doing much better now then for your dogs you check their ears if their ears are hot their nose are dry are there throwing up what are having shortness of breath you need to keep their water bowls real clean and sanitary and sanitize whatever you washed them with and dogs can take aspirin so an aspirin is working so I just wanted to let you know that I love you have a good day.
Hey kid look if any of your family is experiencing fever and pneumonia type symptoms NHK news says you need to get the AIDS vaccine that's what you need to get
There are two areas in the Bible that is about China one in Genesis and one in Revelation China is Magog
Right now we are at Revelations 16 Revelations is also synonymous with reveal God does not reveal anything until it's time well we are at Revelation 16 we only have six more chapters to live through so check those chapters out so you'll be prepared
The next thing is hail 75 lb and more something for that there's going to be a great earthquake in Babylon and Babylon is I don't know where the hell battle on is when hailstones fall 75 lb wake up
Here is Dad's original copy of his change of address dated November 26th 2019 the letter he got where's the letter you got oh that was CenterState oh what do you want housing authority or whatever show the date of the envelope I sent you was for CenterState so yeah take her envelopes with you
You look like Clint Walker on Cheyenne his name is Cheyenne Bodie he's a big man with a real deep voice
Barney did you get my message
not yet
I left a message on your phone
One day I may be getting an electric bike and the people who put it together or out in Redlands and I would have to go pick it up I imagine and I was thinking you and your son you have a big car you could probably fit in there it's probably about as big as my bike now but I don't have a battery on it you know above the tire on the little rack
I'll pay for the gas and lunch and whatever
I'll forget it I'll run to car I can do that
Can you play up up and away on your armpit?
I'm watching Roseanne and she said some guy did that all the time I just remember when you used to play your armpit
I'll never figure out how you learn something like that I never wasn't for me that's for sure
I can do the armpit thing
That's funny
How did you learn that how did you learn something like that you were what in first or second grade you were part in your arm around who taught you that
If I had that VCR video camera I would have been able to videotape you
But I can assure you I'll never forget it
Brian why don't you purchase the lot next door to you and then you could sell it for more money or do something with it but try to get that lot next door to you
You know you could make a little neighborhood park there or do something with it and use it as a tax write-off
You would have to check with zoning to see what you can do with that property
Because elementary kids could gather there and they could go on a hike up in the mountains you know
Or maybe an old folks home you're going to have to use your thinking cap Bryan
But absolutely no rehabilitation or facilities because I'll just bring bad traffic
If you make it into a retire home like an old folks home you can get a government loan that's for sure and you could pay that off and no time
You might want to enroll in medical and medical billing classes
Your cousin Christina riggins is educated in this field
Or you can open up a garden or plant a garden your friendly neighborhood Gardner fruits and vegetables whatever vegetables I guess
Like a greenhouse yeah greenhouse might work Gloria would probably love that
Did you know that nothing in the whole wide world can never stop a mother from loving her chickens
Children + kittens equals chickens


When are you going to have a baby Bryan question mark is just send your pregnant yet?
Just know that the first baby is always the hardest one on a woman it's excruciating week in the cold so make sure she takes her oil capsules make sure she's old up well and make sure she stretches her bones her hips and everything a woman needs to do that and you have to be her coach
"
And if her Susie doesn't stretch wide enough she's going to end up with an episiotomy that's where they stitch you up so just make sure she's prepared when she however she gives birth just be sure she's prepared for all of that"
You know what I'm pretty sure you and Nicole should go try out for American idol you both are so talented
Not just talented but you have charisma you have life about you it's like you know when you were younger you too or the next best thing to McDonald's Happy Land
I mean like you two were both born live entertainers that's for sure and just do it for the fun of it win or lose just go for the fun
Because fun people always win
Thanks mom
I hope you're okay I'm getting so worried about you guys and I got to call Nicole and I I hope she's okay I get scared cuz you guys are around a lot of people aspirin and top ramen chicken noodle soup

What are you get your height from Grandma side of the family her brothers were very tall people Craig very tall you're very tall that's why you're tall
Craig son William is very tall and Rhonda sons Terrence is extremely tall they're both about six foot four
Hey kid how is your friend Ryan Decker doing such a nice guy
You look like this guy he played in a TV show called Cheyenne


And I pray that you have peace and contentment in this life as we know it right now Bible says it's not going to get any better we're probably the worst stage we're at so make a baby if you don't have anything else to do get some kids I'll bring so much joy to your life.
On YouTube they have a lot of really good Bible things and who was the first guy who got took up I wasn't Elijah it was I can't remember his name anyways the guy before Elijah that God took up God is a great YouTuber and there's like two or three of them

Brickell, I've been trying to contact Brian I don't know if he's okay he has not responded can you try to contact him please ?
Ÿ˜“
I'm fine mom 
Ÿ™ƒ
Hey kid how you doing
Good how about you mom?
You know I was thinking of the things that traumatized our own personal beans and for me it was getting electrocuted for you you drown and for Nicole she ended up in the foster care system so all three of us have had these traumatic things that have happened to us anyways somehow we have overcome them and I'm going to be 58 and I have been dealing with like I'll think of one and two things to do and I'll do the first thing and then I'll completely forget what I was going to do the second thing God probably has something to do with being electrocuted not an erp number it's just like a short circuit for you you weren't able to skateboard and I'm sure that had something to do with you drowning so anyways just remember 5 clothes that fit the size of your head cuz you got a big head don't put on small tight clothes they don't balance you out love Mom
Well I had some Chili's and salad Catalina island sauce and cottage cheese and it was very good
Nicole had to color her hair like chestnut brown because she can't get her hair done did she send you a picture


Well it's not chestnut brown it's blondish brown it looks chestnut brown when it's wet


I was telling Nicole that she should have been a model and she should go take her family to go be models for like kohls Marshalls or Macy's and then I was telling her Brian could be a model to but I think his shirts and his shorts are too tight for him he needs to wear bigger clothes because he has a big head and he has a big feet that's where all this came from anyways just the size of your head and the size of your feet
Look at Axel stats I think you and axel were about the same links Axl weighed more than a pound than you did I have no idea the size of his head but yours was either 12 or 13 in
Remember you come from more of a western culture then a city culture you have to lean more towards Western


Hey I tried quitting smoking and quitting drinking beer and going out for walks but I just ended up feeling sick so I'm pretty sure beer helps keep the coronavirus away
Tomorrow Katy Kat has an appointment at the beauty salon but I still can clipped her nails I clean her ears and I got a comb her hair out real good because she has to get her hair clip she's shedding like crazy
Beer helps the coronavirus that's awesome 
Ÿ˜‚Ÿ˜ƒ
Look Nicole looks just like Cher




Yes drink beer plenty of it and if you get a sore throat take aspirin
You see from my estimations in my theory the world has turned into trash all the pollution all the dirt and trash in the world all the ocean pollution and it's just like a trash gern you know germs that collecting the trash bins well if you drink enough alcohol your sterilize from all that junk
I just bought two rolls of rice crackers and I had one and I put some peanut butter on it it was so good I love it
There was a grandma on the news tonight hosting up a sign saying I need more beer on the nightly news with Lester Holt
I'm going to go get some cheese jalapeno hoffy hot dogs
Brian with a y this is your mother now then you know my predicament I'm trying to get Dad on housing hopefully they move fast enough now look here you don't have to say anything but I have a feeling I'll fonzo is abusing Nicole okay I want to get Nicole down here and get her on housing and I may need your help she Abigail and the baby may need to come down and stay here do you have an extra room for them.
Because if you don't her only other option is to defend ourselves and kill that mother f***** if he's abusing her
This is serious please do not take this lightly


I would rather her live with you and to go live in a shelter or she doesn't know anybody and expose our children to strangers
If she feels she can deal with it great but it's just unacceptable so anyways she does have Laura and Mike up there she can run the damn but I have a feeling she's going to need to get on housing because being beat up and getting your face broken it's just wrong
Hopefully I'll ponzo gets back to work I don't know what the situation is Brian but I do know that Nicole is getting hurt so hopefully I'll fonzo goes back to work
Now then here's another option if she wants to run to a shelter from The Storm which would be appropriate for a minute she can run down here and get in a shelter from The Storm if there is no court order that her children have to stay up in that county so she could do that if there is no court order holding our children there


It's right on the corner where the eggs places there's a bunch of apartments behind that aids place I think that's where it is you're on the corner of vista chino and sunrise
Okay so I told her and there's nothing that we can do she has to do it herself there's nothing we can do it's up to her I don't know for facts I'm just telling her that I'm here for her whenever she needs me so that's all we need to let her know if you choose to say anything don't say anything but just tell her to call if you ever need me I'm here for you because there's nothing we can do at all. Not a thing

Hair all read to you my poem
Like the fool I follow my heart before I fall on my head and that is why I follow you for you or the captor of my heart
With the curiosity of the unknown you have enslaved my Wonder and Rich my spirit and how seduce my soul
Like the beast you feed the fire that fuels the passion that burns me with desire
Alone I am but an instrument together we are symphony.
Most excellent choice thank you so much I'm like in the 7th heaven thank you again Brian dad is like going I never seen anybody deliver food for a birthday this is new to him but he's like crazy about it

Good night thanks for a really nice day Bryan. It was awesome thank you again
Brian the coronavirus came from China's wet markets apparently there are bats in there and the dead bats that we're dead on the meat I'm infected the maids and the fish China slaughtered puppies and dogs and monkeys and the fish even these things weren't affected and Nancy pelosi invited everybody to come to China so we could all get sick it's all coming together is called let me show you what it is effectively jeon ji Chang
And it went from that to a biological weapon which Nancy pelosi instigated Nancy pelosi hates Donald Trump just like Hillary does and she hates America she doesn't she wants everybody dead

Well if it is you're on the cover of an amazing facts magazine


Brian do you know that truck drivers cannot drive through the drive-through at the fast food places you might want to open up a business where there are cars guys in cars that are available to drive the truck drivers through the drive-thru because every place is closed
You should go Cruise the off-ramps where the trucks get off and post up a sign truck drivers need a ride through the drive-thru start something
Brian a barrel of oil is going for $0.01 $0.01 I did not stutter you should buy a lot of it

This is my grandma on Mom's side she died in a house fire she had hair when she sat down all the way to the ground my dad said she was Indian
Brian this is Nicole's grandma
Do you see a resemblance


Absolutely!
Is that insane oh my gosh I can't believe it that's crazy
The crazy thing is is Nicole's great grandmother's maiden name was Allen that's Melba's last name Don's grandmother Nicole's great-grandmother her last name was Allen
Look at look at this chick Cheryl she's the mom that's Don and Cindy I can totally see Nicole there for a second

Brian you need to check out Bitcoin and look up if Bitcoin is a form of money laundering they're saying this on TV right now
The best way to launder money is with cash.  Cash is untraceable.  Bitcoin can be traced all the way through its entire transaction history publically
Cash is how you launder money not bitcoin
Okay I'm glad you researched it thank you.
Brian if you and your senia ever drive up to northern California where Nicole is I have to get to her a sewing machine and sewing stuff to her it's my grandmother's sewing machine it's an exquisite sewing machine and Abigail's going to be wanting to make her prom dress so if you win Yesenia ever travel up there maybe you can take me in a sewing machine and the stuff I have and leave me there for three days and then come back and take me home
But you'll have to ask Nicole if she can do that
And you don't have to worry about me packing a suitcase I wear my house dresses for weeks on it so it would just be something like a duffel bag and the rest is the sewing stuff
You know a real funny movie to watch would be dumb and dumber not movie crack me up I mean it was so stupid it was funny
Love that movie
you know you got to hand it to Jim Carrey I mean that had to be about the most stupid movie ever in the whole wide world and and then mask had to be the most sensational movie ever made
For real
Well I guess I just wanted to tell you I love you and I hope everything is okay for you I'm hanging in there
Brian have you watched that video of the corrupt for four?
When you watch it they talk about Nancy pelosi's father Alessandro he brought in heroin to our country in the Vietnam war was coming in when it was a red herring the Vietnam war was a red herring to drug 2 Watergate when they brought drugs into our country they leave that out they leave that connection out but they do say something about it
And I want you to know as much as I love Gavin newsom he is Nancy pelosi's nephew and he is a wolf in sheep's clothing if you ever want to see a wolf in sheep clothing that is Gavin newsom
Just remember if it sounds too good to be true it probably is a sham so you need to be on alert
Ride with it as much as you can but whatever you do do not throw him back in the office I do not vote Nancy pelosi back into office we need to eradicate these kind of people who are infiltrating our country I was a drug addict as you know so I'm coming to you from a former drug addict
Brian take advantage of this time take advantage of him take it to the fullest length but don't you dare go out to the beaches don't you dare go out and protest because only the stupid people are going to do that and they're going to get sick and die take advantage of what newsome house but don't you don't vote for him don't vote for Nancy just watch that corrupt for and you will see Gavin newsom is a wolf in sheep's clothing
Add hey there may be times you may have to pretend and say oh I love Gavin newsom there may be times like that
Have you ever listen to Earth wind & fire are the Commodores man that was back in the 80s they were I loved them

Barney do you know what's really cool to do you got pumpkins you hollow them out you put a little bit of soil in the bottom and then you take a pot of flowers and you put them inside the pumpkin and you have a potted plant and then when the pumpkin gets old you take the pumpkin and you go bury it in the ground somewhere and then just water it and it makes the soil good
Liked â€œBarney do you know what's really cool to do you got pumpkins you hollow them out you put a little bit of soil in the bottom and then you take a pot of flowers and you put them inside the pumpkin and you have a potted plant and then when the pumpkin gets old you take the pumpkin and you go bury it in the ground somewhere and then just water it and it makes the soil goodâ€

Brian you should get one of those carpets that look like there's a hole in the floor and it makes you think like if you step on it you're going to fall in I love those I mean they freak me out but I think it's a pretty cool trick.
and I bet if somebody really believe they were going to fall in they would probably really disappear it really plays with your psyche that's for sure
It's probably like spontaneous combustion if that's a real thing.
"Hey Brian you know I just need to tell you that you know what you were the best thing that ever happened to me you were I just loved you so much. And but you are kind of a tough little kids sometimes you are aliment sometimes you just wouldn't listen when it was super important but you know you were just a kid and I just want to tell you I am so very sorry that you ever got hurt from Nicole's dad I am so sorry about that I had I did not think Tom would ever do that to a child that's just freaking crazy I need to tell you I never thought he would do that to you I still cry about it to this day. I just I can't explain it but I really don't understand I can understand that you know I probably just wasn't good enough for any man and they thought they had the right to abuse me because my parents tour my ass up and men saw that and they figured we can abused this can I please this one her parents abused her so we can abuse her and you know what I'm both my parents should have been!
  sent to jail for what they did to me. I thought you were the one. You're one of the happiest things that ever happened to me in my life and I just want to thank you and I thank God. Love Mom"

So I'm just trying to suck the blood out of where I polka from
You know I took pharmacology wow that was crazy!

I got to send Nicola Pizza I got to do something nice I'm so damn mad
Sorry you're so mad mom. The snake was great. I got joel with it last night he thought it was hilarious 


Guess it's top secret information you have to keep it information concealed because you have to pull that trick on anybody knew who hasn't done it so anybody who has done it it has to be top secret information
Anybody who knows about it is on and inside circle they cannot tell anybody and if they do if they do well we'll just have to deal with that when it happens
And you have to videotape the incident when it happens you know when they open up the can you have to videotape it and put it on world's funniest videos
You know you could win like $10,000 and anybody who tells The secret gets none of the money
I sent niccoli one of those fart banks at I sent her a snake in the can she doesn't know it yet don't tell her
Who knew you could pull in Bank on a fart?
Now that's easy money 
I bet if I went around I asked people give me a dollar and I'll fart I could probably make some good money Ÿ`
You could post of us sign say hey I'll fart for a dollar
Are you could stand on the corner too with your fart bank and your snake can and say give me 50 cent you can open up my can of chips I mean why don't you make money with this stuff
Hey if you want a great summer time job delivering newspapers for the desert sun is great because you're going to work at night time when it's really beautiful
Then you can say your prayers because Jesus was always up at 3 in the morning saying his prayers to God
And then you can save all the money you make and go for a neighborhood block party and charge $2 a head
As of today this is your Aunt Julie's favorite song oh my God is so hilarious
